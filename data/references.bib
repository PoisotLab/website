                  scientific knowledge through the insertion of unconscious
                  biases during the research process. These biases frequently
                  cause overestimation of the effects under study, thereby
                  violating the reproducibility of the research and potentially
                  leading to incorrect conclusions in subsequent research
                  syntheses. We explored the level of knowledge about biases and
                  attitudes to this problem by analysing 308 responses of
                  ecology scientists to a specifically developed survey. We show
                  that knowledge about biases and attitude towards biases depend
                  on the scientist's career stage, gender and affiliation
                  country. Early career scientists are more concerned about
                  biases, know more about measures to avoid biases, and twice
                  more frequently have learned about biases from their
                  university courses when compared with senior scientists. The
                  respondents believe that their own studies are less prone to
                  biases than are studies by other scientists, which hampers the
                  control of biases in one's own research. We conclude that
                  education about biases is necessary, but not yet sufficient,
                  to avoid biases because the unconscious origin of biases
                  necessitates external intervention to combat them. Obligatory
                  reporting of measures taken against biases in all relevant
                  manuscripts will likely enhance the reproducibility of
                  scientific results.},

                  sciences. The extent of most forms of bias has scarcely been
                  confronted with rigorous data. In the present article, we
                  evaluated the potential for geographic, taxonomic, and
                  citation biases in publications between temperate and tropical
                  systems for nine broad topics in ecology and evolutionary
                  biology. Across 1,800 papers sampled from 60,000
                  peer-reviewed, empirical studies, we found consistent patterns
                  of bias in the form of increased numbers of studies in
                  temperate systems. Tropical studies were nearly absent from
                  some topics. Furthermore, there were strong taxonomic biases
                  across topics and geographic regions, as well as evidence for
                  citation biases in many topics. Our results indicate a strong
                  geographic imbalance in publishing patterns and among
                  different taxonomic groups across a wide range of topics. The
                  task ahead is to address what these biases mean and how they
                  influence the state of our knowledge in ecology and evolution.},

                  research and education is a highly topical issue. The recent
                  release of ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre‐trained Transformer)
                  by OpenAI on November 30, 2022 has opened up new possibilities
                  for the use of chatbot services in ecological research and
                  education. In this perspective article, we address associated
                  contemporary topics including the use of chatbot services in
                  ecology education and academic writing, the application of AI
                  in ecology, the potential environmental impact, and ethical
                  considerations of using such services. Several logistical,
                  ethical and environmental factors were identified that should
                  be considered in the context of ecological research. We argue
                  that ChatGPT can help reduce the workload of researchers,
                  generate new insights and ideas, and serve as a personal
                  instructor and assistant for students. While we show how AI
                  chatbots have the potential to be useful assets for
                  ecologists, several challenges arose. AI in ecological
                  research includes the limited ability of AI algorithms to
                  capture complexity and nuance, the dependence of AI models on
                  data quality, and ethical concerns about the use of AI in
                  research. The construction and operation of such services also
                  have potential environmental impacts but may also provide
                  environmental benefits in comparison with other conventional
                  approaches, all of which should be evaluated. Despite these
                  limitations and challenges, we consider that the use of AI can
                  be a valuable tool in ecological research and could enhance
                  the speed and efficiency of research by automating certain
                  tasks (e.g. data collection and management) and analyzing
                  large amounts of data. However, we emphasize the importance of
                  taking a responsible, sustainable and transparent approach to
                  using chatbot services and AI in ecological research and
                  education, while remaining mindful of the potential impact on
                  the environment, society, and ethical concerns.},

                  for writing succinct and rigorous descriptions of
                  probabilistic models and inference tasks. Several
                  probabilistic programming languages, including Anglican,
                  Church or Hakaru, derive their expressiveness from a powerful
                  combination of continuous distributions, conditioning, and
                  higher-order functions. Although very important for practical
                  applications, these features raise fundamental challenges for
                  program semantics and verification. Several recent works offer
                  promising answers to these challenges, but their primary focus
                  is on foundational semantics issues. In this paper, we take a
                  step further by developing a suite of logics, collectively
                  named PPV for proving properties of programs written in an
                  expressive probabilistic higher-order language with continuous
                  sampling operations and primitives for conditioning
                  distributions. Our logics mimic the comfortable reasoning
                  style of informal proofs using carefully selected
                  axiomatizations of key results from probability theory. The
                  versatility of our logics is illustrated through the formal
                  verification of several intricate examples from statistics,
                  probabilistic inference, and machine learning. We further show
                  expressiveness by giving sound embeddings of existing logics.
                  In particular, we do this in a parametric way by showing how
                  the semantics idea of (unary and relational) ⊤⊤-lifting can be
                  internalized in our logics. The soundness of PPV follows by
                  interpreting programs and assertions in quasi-Borel spaces
                  (QBS), a recently proposed variant of Borel spaces with a good
                  structure for interpreting higher order probabilistic
                  programs.},

                  Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal
                  linguistic competence--knowledge of linguistic rules and
                  patterns--and functional linguistic competence--understanding
                  and using language in the world. We ground this distinction in
                  human neuroscience, showing that formal and functional
                  competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs
                  are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance
                  on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often
                  requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external
                  modules. In short, LLMs are good models of language but

              generated images have been shared on the Internet. Meanwhile,
              today's success of deep learning in the computer vision field owes
              a lot to images collected from the Internet. These trends lead us
              to a research question: "\textbf{will such generated images impact
              the quality of future datasets and the performance of computer
              vision models positively or negatively?}" This paper empirically
              answers this question by simulating contamination. Namely, we
              generate ImageNet-scale and COCO-scale datasets using a
              state-of-the-art generative model and evaluate models trained with
              "contaminated" datasets on various tasks, including image
              classification and image generation. Throughout experiments, we
              conclude that generated images negatively affect downstream

              amount of generated images. The generated datasets and the codes
              for experiments will be publicly released for future research.

                  in deductive complexity but matched in linguistic complexity.
                  Arguments also varied in lexical content, involving blocks and
                  pseudo-words in Experiment I and faces and houses in
                  Experiment II. For each experiment, subtraction of simple from

                  medial (BA 8) prefrontal cortex, perform deductive operations.
                  Finally, restricting the complex-simple subtraction to each

                  habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism
                  drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives
                  generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct
                  direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma,
                  previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on
                  formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism.
                  Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding
                  skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal
                  discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on
                  information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work,
                  all three independent methods strongly indicate that
                  generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on
                  plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we
                  find that selection processes are more important than drift
                  processes in structuring multispecies systems when the
                  environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the

                  that cause human disease. We present data from 162 papers (of
                  1322) with original findings on (1) numbers and species of
                  bats sampled across bat families and the continent, (2) how
                  bats were selected for study inclusion, (3) if bats were
                  terminally sampled, (4) what types of ecological data, if any,
                  were recorded and (5) which viruses were detected and with
                  what methodology. We propose a scheme for evaluating presumed
                  virus–host relationships by evidence type and quality, using
                  the contrasting available evidence for Orthoebolavirus versus
                  Orthomarburgvirus as an example. We review the wording in
                  abstracts and discussions of all 162 papers, identifying key
                  framing terms, how these refer to findings, and how they might
                  contribute to people's beliefs about bats. We discuss the
                  impact of scientific research communication on public
                  perception and emphasize the need for strategies that minimize
                  human–bat conflict and support bat conservation. Finally, we
                  make recommendations for best practices that will improve
                  virological study metadata.},

                  the growing mobility of the human population; 4) the rapid

                  biogeographic boundaries may mitigate this spread by

                  among plant-frugivore networks, while accounting for
                  background spatial and elevational gradients and differences
                  in network sampling. We assessed network dissimilarity
                  patterns over a broad spatial scale, using 196 quantitative
                  avian frugivory networks (encompassing 1496 plant and 1004
                  bird species) distributed across 67 ecoregions, 11 biomes, and

                  needed to identify host species with a high risk of zoonotic
                  disease spillover. While several predictors of pathogen
                  richness in wildlife hosts have been proposed, their relative
                  importance has not been formally examined. This hampers our
                  ability to identify potential disease reservoirs, particularly
                  in remote areas with limited surveillance efforts. Here we
                  analyzed 14 proposed predictors of pathogen richness using
                  ensemble modeling and a dataset of 1040 host species to
                  identify the most important predictors of pathogen richness in
                  wild mammal species. After controlling for research effort,
                  larger species geographic range area was identified to be
                  associated with higher pathogen richness. We found evidence of
                  duality in the relationship between the fast–slow continuum of
                  life-history traits and pathogen richness, where pathogen
                  richness increases near the extremities. Taxonomic orders
                  Carnivora, Proboscidea, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla were
                  predicted to host high pathogen richness. The top three
                  species with the highest pathogen richness predicted by our
                  ensemble model were Canis lupus, Sus scrofa, and Alces alces.

                  However, understanding of the underlying factors driving the
                  geographic distribution of such funding remains limited. This
                  study aimed to identify the relative importance of five

                  Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and preexisting
                  investment) that potentially influence conservation funding
                  allocation at the subnational level in major deforestation
                  regions of South America between 1987 and 2013. Overall, we
                  found that funding was mainly allocated to remote areas with
                  high species richness and carbon storage, while areas with
                  high threat levels were often overlooked, especially until
                  2008. After 2008, international donors committed more funding
                  to areas with high carbon storage, but not areas with high
                  species richness, suggesting the prominence of climate-related
                  concerns over biodiversity conservation. Although often
                  advocated, we did not find evidence supporting Indigenous
                  Peoples and local communities being important in explaining
                  funding allocation. However, we identified a strong preference
                  for the Amazon as a charismatic ecoregion. Our findings
                  underscore the diverse and changing factors that drive

                  different actors. We hope that our study will contribute to

                  approaches to combat bacterial infections and better
                  understanding microbial ecology. Experimental studies on
                  phage-bacteria interactions have been mostly focusing on a few
                  model organisms to understand the molecular mechanisms which
                  makes a particular bacterial strain susceptible to a given
                  phage. However, both bacteria and phages are extremely diverse
                  in natural contexts. How well the concepts learned from
                  well-established experimental models generalize to a broad
                  diversity of what is encountered in the wild is currently
                  unknown. Recent advances in genomics allow to identify traits
                  involved in phage-host specificity, implying that these traits
                  could be utilized for the prediction of such interactions.
                  Here, we show that we could predict outcomes of most
                  phage-bacteria interactions at the strain level in Escherichia
                  natural isolates based solely on genomic data. First, we
                  established a dataset of experimental outcomes of
                  phage-bacteria interactions of 403 natural, phylogenetically
                  diverse, Escherichia strains to 96 bacteriophages matched with
                  fully sequenced and genomically characterized strains and
                  phages. To predict these interactions, we set out to define
                  genomic traits with predictive power. We show that most
                  interactions in our dataset can be explained by adsorption
                  factors as opposed to antiphage systems which play a marginal
                  role. We then trained predictive algorithms to pinpoint which
                  interactions could be accurately predicted and where future
                  research should focus on. Finally, we show the application of
                  such predictions by establishing a pipeline to recommend
                  tailored phage cocktails to target pathogenic strains from
                  their genomes only and show higher efficiency of tailored
                  cocktails on a collection of 100 pathogenic E. coli isolates.
                  Altogether, this work provides quantitative insights into
                  understanding phage-host specificity at the strain level and

                  milestone in computational programming, mathematical analysis,
                  and statistical modeling. Having reached its stable release in
                  version 1.9.0 on May 7, 2023, Julia has developed into a
                  powerful and versatile instrument. Despite its potential and
                  widespread adoption across various scientific and technical
                  domains, it can be utilized within biological sciences. The
                  Aim of Review This comprehensive review aims to address this
                  particular knowledge gap and offer a thorough examination of
                  Julia's fundamental characteristics and its applications in
                  biology. Key scientific concepts of the review The review
                  focuses on a research gap in the biological science. The
                  review aims to equip researchers with knowledge and tools to
                  utilize Julia's capabilities in biological science effectively
                  and to demonstrate the gap. It paves the way for innovative
                  solutions and discoveries in this rapidly evolving field. It
                  encompasses an analysis of Julia's characteristics, packages,
                  and performance compared to the programming languages in this
                  field. The initial part of this review discusses the key
                  features of Julia, such as its dynamic and interactive nature,
                  fast processing speed, ease of expression manipulation,
                  user-friendly syntax, code readability, strong support for
                  multiple dispatch, and advanced type system. It also explores
                  Julia's capabilities in data analysis, visualization, machine
                  learning, and algorithms, making it suitable for scientific
                  applications. The next section emphasizes the importance of
                  using Julia in biological research, highlighting its seamless
                  integration with biological studies for data analysis,
                  computational biology, and bioinformatics. It also compares

                  are of zoonotic origin, and of those, around 70\% were
                  identified to start with wild animals. To better understand
                  the impacts of zoonotic diseases on wildlife, there is a need
                  to identify the distribution and impact of zoonotic pathogens
                  in wildlife, particular those species with threatened
                  populations. To investigate this question, we constructed a
                  zoonotic disease database identifying wildlife hosts for each
                  bacterial zoonotic disease and recorded clinical signs of
                  disease for each host-pathogen relationship if found. Species
                  of least concern were found to have a significantly higher
                  prevalence and richness of zoonotic bacterial diseases (n=
                  0.0608, x2 = 5.898, p=0.01516). The taxonomic level Order was
                  found to be the best predictor for pathogen richness, and the
                  Artiodactyla and Carnivora contain a significantly higher
                  pathogen richness than other vertebrate Orders. Species with
                  the greatest pathogen richness include the wild boar (Sus
                  scrofa, n=66), Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor, n=16) and the
                  red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n=41). Our results indicate bacterial
                  zoonoses are not likely to be a driving factor of species
                  population declines, and future zoonotic disease surveillance
                  efforts should target species in the Artiodactyla and
                  Carnivora families. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) in particular
                  may be a good candidate for zoonotic disease monitoring due to
                  its high pathogen richness, wide range, and large population.
                  Understanding the impacts and distribution of bacterial
                  zoonoses in wildlife populations can help in planning for
                  future wildlife management efforts, particularly in species of
                  conservation concern and wildlife disease monitoring.}

                  exponential in co-occurrence networks to power laws in
                  networks of biotic interactions. This shift results from a

                  reveals that their relative biomass is low compared with that
                  of other trophic groups. However there is increasing evidence
                  that parasite-mediated effects could be significant: they
                  shape host population dynamics, alter interspecific
                  competition, influence energy flow and appear to be important
                  drivers of biodiversity. Indeed they influence a range of
                  ecosystem functions and have a major effect on the structure
                  of some food webs. Here, we consider the bottom-up and
                  top-down processes of how parasitism influences ecosystem
                  functioning and show that there is evidence that parasites are
                  important for biodiversity and production; thus, we consider a
                  healthy system to be one that is rich in parasite species.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Conceptual frameworks are recommended as a way of
                  applying theory to enhance implementation efforts. The
                  Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by
                  Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31
                  planned action theories. The framework has two components:
                  Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which
                  comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two
                  questions: 'Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so,
                  how?' METHODS: This study is a citation analysis and
                  systematic review. The index citation for the original paper
                  was identified on three databases-Web of Science, Scopus and
                  Google Scholar-with the facility for citation searching.
                  Limitations of English language and year of publication
                  2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum
                  of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to
                  implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and
                  mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where
                  it was integral to the implementation project. RESULTS: The
                  citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles
                  and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies
                  described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to
                  integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to
                  the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation
                  activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven
                  referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted
                  in different health care and academic settings with projects
                  targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied
                  health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The KTA Framework is being
                  used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is
                  frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution
                  via a reference, through informing planning, to making an
                  intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to
                  knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways
                  and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages
                  the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet
                  their application is less evident in practice. This may be an
                  artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary
                  research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA
                  Framework and similar tools.},

                  topics, it remains unclear how synthesis has affected the
                  discipline. Using a case study of publications (n = 2304) from
                  the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
                  compared with papers with similar keywords from the Web of
                  Science (n = 320,000), we address several questions about the
                  comparative impact of synthesis, the role of synthesis in
                  driving key research themes, and whether synthesis is focused
                  on different topics than is the broader ecological literature.
                  We found much higher citation rates for synthesis papers
                  overall (fivefold more) and within eleven key topic themes
                  (e.g., species richness, biodiversity, climate change, global
                  change). Synthesis papers often played key roles in driving,
                  redirecting, or resolving core questions and exhibited much
                  greater cross-theme connectivity. Together, these results
                  indicate that synthesis in science has played a crucial role

                  in science. The present article considers some questionable
                  metascience practices (QMPs) that may threaten scientists’
                  trust in metascience. A QMP is a research practice,
                  assumption, or perspective that has been questioned by several
                  commentators as being potentially problematic for the
                  credibility of metascience and/or the science reform movement.
                  The present article reviews 10 QMPs that relate to criticism,
                  replication, bias, generalization, and the characterization of
                  science. Specifically, the following QMPs are considered: (1)
                  rejecting or ignoring self-criticism; (2) a fast ‘n’ bropen
                  scientific criticism style; (3) overplaying the role of
                  replication in science; (4) assuming a replication rate is
                  “too low” without specifying an “acceptable” rate; (5) an
                  unacknowledged metabias towards explaining the replication
                  crisis in terms of researcher bias; (6) assuming that
                  researcher bias can be reduced; (7) devaluing exploratory
                  results as more “tentative” than confirmatory results; (8)
                  presuming that QRPs are problematic research practices; (9)
                  focusing on knowledge accumulation as an index of scientific
                  progress; and (10) focusing on specific scientific methods. It
                  is stressed that only some metascientists engage in some QMPs
                  some of the time, and that these QMPs may not always be
                  problematic. Research is required to estimate the prevalence
                  and impact of QMPs. In the meantime, QMPs should be viewed as
                  invitations to ask “questions” about how we go about doing
                  metascience rather than as grounds for mistrusting the
                  credibility of metascience.},

                  roles (TIRs) who support research through specialised skills,
                  but do not have primary responsibility for conceiving or
                  leading research projects. TIRs such as Lab Technicians,

                  Research Software Engineers all play an important role in

                  which focus on the individual academic researcher instead of
                  the teams involved. Without meaningful identification and
                  recognition of TIR contributions, we risk reinforcing the
                  conceptual and practical division between academic researchers

                  and enabling environmental managers and policymakers to make
                  informed decisions. Poorly supported management can have
                  detrimental, costly or irreversible impacts on the environment
                  and society. Here, we examine common issues in ecological
                  modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling
                  frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is
                  crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the
                  available data and understanding of ecological structures.
                  Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over
                  parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a
                  lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to
                  predict ecological systems' responses to management.
                  Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of
                  model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a
                  series of critical questions regarding state and control
                  variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the

                  software systems. Creating and specializing DNNs from scratch
                  has grown increasingly difficult as state-of-the-art
                  architectures grow more complex. Following the path of
                  traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers
                  have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and
                  fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. Prior works have
                  studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to
                  guide software engineers towards better package maintenance
                  and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of
                  knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems.
                  In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of
                  PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most
                  popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices
                  and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the
                  decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified
                  practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse,
                  including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three
                  challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies
                  between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We
                  substantiate these identified challenges with systematic
                  measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs
                  future directions on optimizing deep learning ecosystems by
                  automated measuring useful attributes and potential attacks,
                  and envision future research on infrastructure and

                  in how researchers collect data and the amount of data being

                  attention in biology is managing, working with, and providing
                  access to data under continual active collection. Regularly
                  updated data present unique challenges in quality assurance
                  and control, data publication, archiving, and reproducibility.
                  We developed a workflow for a long-term ecological study that
                  addresses many of the challenges associated with managing this
                  type of data. We do this by leveraging existing tools to 1)
                  perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure,
                  version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways
                  that ensure appropriate credit to all contributors; and 4)
                  automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time
                  and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages
                  tools from software development, including version control and
                  continuous integration, to create a modern data management

                  meaning of vulnerability has proved extremely difficult. On
                  the one hand, it is an increasingly formalised term that means
                  something very specific scientifically and methodologically
                  within the climate change institutions. On the other hand,
                  vulnerability is part of a colonial discursive framework of
                  risk. In this article, I show how contestations into the
                  scientific project have not sufficiently worked to address the
                  colonial geographic imaginaries that underlie the discursive
                  framework of vulnerability. I suggest that bringing together
                  the work of critical adaptation studies (CAS) with critical
                  feminist and decolonial scholarship, such as the
                  counternarratives of the Pacific,offers a way to resist the
                  victimising politics of disposability and also rethink

                  neanderthalensis) and the question of whether or not they
                  dispersed into Southern Scandinavia, two contradictory
                  hypotheses can be identified. The first, and also the most
                  widely endorsed, hereafter, hypothesis A, argues primarily
                  that Neanderthals did not occupy regions above 55°N because of
                  1) climatic constraints and 2) dispersal barriers. The second,
                  hypothesis B, argues that they possibly occasionally dispersed
                  above 55°N, but that factors such as 1) research- and/or 2)
                  taphonomic bias are responsible for their archaeological
                  invisibility. Here, we report an evaluation of these competing
                  hypotheses. To this end, we reconstruct the environment for
                  the time period and region of interest (the Last Interglacial
                  Complex and Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia), based
                  on three lines of evidence: palaeoenvironmental reconstruction
                  combined with a novel habitat modelling approach, a review of
                  relevant archaeological localities, and a discussion of the
                  possible impacts of both research biases and the taphonomic
                  effects on the archaeological data. We focus particularly on
                  the climatic and geological explanatory factors relevant to
                  the two hypotheses. Our results are inconsistent with the
                  claim that climatic constraint and/or a lack of suitable
                  habitats can fully explain the absence of Neanderthals in
                  Southern Scandinavia during the Eemian Interglacial and Early
                  Weichselian Glaciation. We do, however, find evidence that a
                  geographic barrier may have impeded northerly migrations
                  during the Eemian. The evidence reviewed here suggests that
                  both research bias and taphonomy – consistent with hypothesis
                  B – could account for the archaeological invisibility of
                  Neanderthals in Southern Scandinavia, highlighting the need
                  for further strategic survey and/or excavation efforts in the
                  region.},

                  scientific data is useful, system developers need to
                  understand what scientists and other intended users do as well
                  as the attitudes and beliefs that shape their behaviours. This
                  paper introduces personas — detailed descriptions of an
                  “archetypical user of a system” — as an approach for capturing
                  and sharing knowledge about potential system users. Setting:
                  Personas were developed to support development of the
                  ‘DataONE’ (Data Observation Network for Earth) project, which
                  has developed and deployed a sustainable long-term data
                  preservation and access network to ensure the preservation and
                  access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national
                  environmental and biological science data
                  (https://www.dataone.org/what-dataone) (Michener et al. 2012).
                  Methods: Personas for DataONE were developed based on data
                  from surveys and interviews done by members of DataONE working
                  groups along with sources such as usage scenarios for DataONE
                  and the Data Conservancy project and the Purdue Data Curation
                  Profiles (Witt et al. 2009). Results: A total of 11 personas
                  were developed: five for various kinds of research scientists
                  (e.g., at different career stages and using different types of
                  data); a science data librarian; and five for secondary roles.
                  Conclusion: Personas were found to be useful for helping
                  developers and other project members to understand users and
                  their needs. The developed DataONE personas may be useful for
                  others trying to develop systems or programs for scientists
                  involved in data sharing.},

                  records that were not gathered in struc­tured surveys (e.g.

                  to address complex environmental issues. While the benefits of
                  team science approaches are clear, researchers often struggle
                  with its implementation, particularly for new team members.
                  The challenges of large projects often weigh on the most
                  vulnerable members of a team: trainees, including
                  undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral
                  researchers. Trainees on big projects have to navigate their
                  role on the team, with learning project policies, procedures,
                  and goals, all while also training in key scientific tasks
                  such as co-authoring papers. To address these challenges, we
                  created and participated in a project-specific, graduate-level
                  team science course. The purposes of this course were to: (1)
                  introduce students to the goals of the project, (2) build
                  trainees' understanding of how big projects operate, and (3)
                  allow trainees to explore how their research interests
                  dovetailed with the overall project. Additionally, trainees
                  received training regarding: (1) diversity, equity \&
                  inclusion, (2) giving and receiving feedback, and (3)
                  effective communication. Onboarding through the team science
                  course cultivated psychological safety and a collaborative
                  student community across disciplines and institutions. Thus,

                  big projects to help students establish the skills necessary
                  for collaborative research. Project-based team science classes
                  can benefit student advancement, enhance the productivity of
                  the project, and accelerate the discovery of solutions to
                  ecological issues by building community, establishing a shared
                  project vocabulary, and building a workforce with

                  tools has expanded the study of analytical paleobiology,
                  contributing to innovative analyses of biodiversity dynamics
                  over Earth's history. Despite-or even spurred by-this growing
                  availability of resources, analytical paleobiology faces
                  deep-rooted obstacles that stem from the need for more
                  equitable access to data and best practices to guide analyses
                  of the fossil record. Recent progress has been accelerated by
                  a collective push toward more collaborative,
                  interdisciplinary, and open science, especially by
                  early-career researchers. Here, we survey four challenges
                  facing analytical paleobiology from an early-career
                  perspective: (1) accounting for biases when interpreting the
                  fossil record; (2) integrating fossil and modern biodiversity
                  data; (3) building data science skills; and (4) increasing
                  data accessibility and equity. We discuss recent efforts to
                  address each challenge, highlight persisting barriers, and
                  identify tools that have advanced analytical work. Given the
                  inherent linkages between these challenges, we encourage
                  discourse across disciplines to find common solutions. We also
                  affirm the need for systemic changes that reevaluate how we
                  conduct and share paleobiological research.},

                  documentation in improving research quality and impact.
                  Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive
                  text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic,
                  and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by
                  nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when
                  producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of
                  this tool in research publication is not common, despite its
                  potential to increase research impact and quality. For a
                  single study, the content of such documentation partially
                  overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the
                  scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to
                  minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files
                  related to these contents and optimize their production, we
                  present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of
                  computational notebooks in the research process, including
                  publication. The kit contains the template of a computational
                  notebook integrated into a research project that employs R,
                  Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we
                  show how computational notebooks also foster the
                  implementation of principles of Open Science, such as
                  reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for
                  beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be
                  gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research
                  workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective
                  starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice
                  in their workflow, regardless of their computational

                  fever virus (YFV) infections in Brazil, our understanding of

                  Here, through a combination of phylogenetic and
                  epidemiological models, we reconstructed the recent
                  transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons
                  in Brazil. A suitability index based on the highly
                  domesticated Aedes aegypti was able to capture the seasonality
                  of reported human infections. Spatial modeling revealed
                  spatial hotspots with both past reporting and low vaccination

                  high niche availability associated with the diversity of host

                  to understand how environmental variation influences species
                  geographical distribution. SDMs are implemented by several
                  different algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms
                  consistently lose accuracy exactly when they are needed the
                  most, that is with rare species, originating the so‐called
                  rare‐species modelling paradox. Although approaches exist to
                  tackle this problem, most notably by performing and then
                  averaging a number of bivariate models, they are usually
                  computationally intensive and were never shown to apply
                  successfully to the rarest species (i.e. with less than 20
                  geographical occurrences). Here, we present a new algorithm,

                  fossil records. ENphylo proved significantly more accurate
                  than ENFA and the ensemble of bivariate models using Maxent,

                  Intriguingly, we found that randomly drawing as little as 10
                  occurrence data points per species allows ENphylo to perform
                  equally well as Maxent run using the entire fossil record of
                  these same species and data. ENphylo provides a fast and
                  accurate solution to perform species distribution modelling
                  with rare species, which will help predicting their
                  distribution in the light of climate change, and to delineate
                  how rare extinct species reacted to past climatic variation.},

                  distribution of species using occurrence data and
                  environmental variables. While data on species presence are
                  increasingly accessible, the difficulty of confirming real
                  absences in the field often forces researchers to generate
                  them in silico. To this aim, pseudo‐absences are commonly
                  sampled randomly across the study area (i.e. the geographical
                  space). However, this introduces sample location bias (i.e.
                  the sampling is unbalanced towards the most frequent habitats
                  occurring within the geographical space) and favours class
                  overlap (i.e. overlap between environmental conditions
                  associated with species presences and pseudo‐absences) in the
                  training dataset. To mitigate this, we propose an alternative
                  methodology (i.e. the uniform approach) that systematically
                  samples pseudo‐absences within a portion of the environmental
                  space delimited by a kernel‐based filter, which seeks to
                  minimise the number of false absences included in the training
                  dataset. We simulated 50 virtual species and modelled their
                  distribution using training datasets assembled with the
                  presence points of the virtual species and pseudo‐absences
                  collected using the uniform approach and other approaches that
                  randomly sample pseudo‐absences within the geographical space.
                  We compared the predictive performance of habitat suitability
                  models and evaluated the extent of sample location bias and
                  class overlap associated with the different sampling
                  strategies. Results indicated that the uniform approach: (i)
                  effectively reduces sample location bias and class overlap;
                  (ii) provides comparable predictive performance to sampling
                  strategies carried out in the geographical space; and (iii)
                  ensures gathering pseudo‐absences adequately representing the
                  environmental conditions available across the study area. We
                  developed a set of R functions in an accompanying R package
                  called USE to disseminate the uniform approach.},

                  network specialization to habitat fragmentation remain
                  unknown, especially for multi-trophic interactions. We here
                  collected a large dataset consisting of 2670 observations of
                  tri-trophic interactions among plants, sap-sucking aphids and
                  honeydew-collecting ants on 18 forested islands in the
                  Thousand Island Lake, China. For each island, we constructed
                  an antagonistic plant–aphid and a mutualistic aphid–ant
                  network, and tested how network specialization varied with
                  island area and isolation. We found that both networks
                  exhibited higher specialization on smaller islands, while only
                  aphid–ant networks had increased specialization on more
                  isolated islands. Variations in network specialization among
                  islands was primarily driven by species turnover, which was
                  interlinked across trophic levels as fragmentation increased
                  the specialization of both antagonistic and mutualistic
                  networks through bottom-up effects via plant and aphid
                  communities. These findings reveal that species on small and
                  isolated islands display higher specialization mainly due to
                  effects of fragmentation on species turnover, with behavioural
                  changes causing interaction rewiring playing only a minor
                  role. Our study highlights the significance of adopting a
                  multi-trophic perspective when exploring patterns and
                  processes in structuring ecological networks in fragmented

                  Epidemiologists first analyzed wastewater to track outbreaks
                  of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based
                  epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels
                  while bypassing the difficulties and pit falls of individual
                  testing. Current approaches overlook the activity of most
                  human viruses and preclude a deeper understanding of human
                  virome community dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive
                  sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater
                  samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical
                  to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting
                  thousands of viral species or variants. Over 450 distinct
                  pathogenic viruses from 28 viral families are observed, most
                  of which have never been detected in such samples. Sequencing
                  reads of established pathogens and emerging viruses correlate

                  monkeypox viruses, outlining the public health utility of this
                  approach. Viral communities are tightly organized by space and
                  time. Finally, the most abundant human viruses yield sequence
                  variant information consistent with regional spread and
                  evolution. We reveal the viral landscape of human wastewater
                  and its potential to improve our understanding of outbreaks,
                  transmission, and its effects on overall population health.},

                  potential complementarity with scientific knowledge. With this

                  published peer-reviewed documents reporting local indicators
                  of climate change (including both local observations of
                  climate change and observed impacts on the biophysical and the

                  benchmark problems/datasets, or with proxy users (e.g., Amazon
                  Mechanical Turk). We argue that these simplified evaluation
                  settings do not capture the nuances and complexities of
                  real-world applications. As a result, the applicability and
                  effectiveness of this large body of theoretical and
                  methodological work in real-world applications are unclear. In
                  this work, we take steps toward addressing this gap for the
                  domain of public policy. First, we identify the primary use
                  cases of explainable ML within public policy problems. For
                  each use case, we define the end users of explanations and the
                  specific goals the explanations have to fulfill. Finally, we
                  map existing work in explainable ML to these use cases,
                  identify gaps in established capabilities, and propose
                  research directions to fill those gaps to have a practical
                  societal impact through ML. The contribution is (a) a
                  methodology for explainable ML researchers to identify use
                  cases and develop methods targeted at them and (b) using that
                  methodology for the domain of public policy and giving an
                  example for the researchers on developing explainable ML
                  methods that result in real-world impact.},

                  exclusion of plant species by determining which plants receive
                  conspecific pollen. A key question is whether realistic
                  pollinator foraging behavior promotes coexistence or exclusion
                  of plant species. We use a simulation model to understand how
                  pollinator foraging behavior impacts the coexistence dynamics
                  of pollen-limited plants. To determine whether pollinators are
                  likely to provide a biologically important coexistence
                  mechanism, we compare our results to bee foraging data from
                  the literature and from a novel experimental analysis. Model
                  results indicate that strong specialization at the level of
                  individual foraging paths is required to promote coexistence.
                  However, few empirical studies have robustly quantified
                  within-bout specialization. Species-level data suggest that
                  foraging behavior is sufficient to permit pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence in species-poor plant communities and possibly in
                  diverse communities where congeneric plants co-occur. Our
                  experiments using bumblebees show that individual-level
                  specialization does exist, but not at levels sufficient to
                  substantially impact coexistence dynamics. The literature on
                  specialization within natural foraging paths suffers from key
                  limitations, but overall suggests that pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence should be rare in diverse plant communities.},

                  non of science, but prediction means different things to
                  different people in different contexts. I organize and explain
                  this diversity by addressing five questions. What does it mean
                  to predict something? To answer this question, I describe
                  concepts of prediction as prophecy, diagnosis, history,
                  repeatability, and fate. What are we trying to predict? Here,
                  I describe how predictions vary along several axes: general to
                  specific, qualitative to quantitative, relative to absolute,
                  point to range, and continuous to discontinuous. Where do
                  predictions come from? In this case, I focus on deductive
                  versus inductive reasoning. How do we test predictions? The
                  answer here is not straightforward and I discuss various
                  approaches and difficulties. How good are predictions? Not
                  surprisingly, it depends on what is being predicted and how we
                  judge success. Importantly, I do not espouse a “best” way to
                  approach prediction but, rather, I outline its diverse

                  structure, I evaluate here how introduced parasites might
                  reorganise food webs. Empirical evidence suggests that
                  introduced parasites alter food webs qualitatively through
                  topological changes and quantitatively through shifts in
                  trophic relationships arising from modified host phenotypic
                  traits. I argue that predicting the extent of food web
                  reorganisation is, however, difficult due to underlying
                  ecological and evolutionary processes that could provide
                  contrasting food web outcomes, including enemy release, biotic
                  resistance, and parasite spillover and spillback.
                  Nevertheless, I suggest these food web reorganisations
                  represent a further aspect of human-mediated global change

                  production and crop pollination, raising concern for wild
                  pollinators, as honey bees may compete with wild pollinators
                  for floral resources. The first sign of competition, before
                  changes appear in wild pollinator abundance or diversity, may
                  be changes to wild pollinator interactions with plants. Such
                  changes for a community can be measured by looking at changes
                  to metrics of resource use overlap in plant-pollinator
                  interaction networks. Studies of honey bee effects on
                  plant-pollinator networks have usually not distinguished
                  whether honey bees alter wild pollinator interactions, or if
                  they merely alter total network structure by adding their own
                  interactions. To test this question, we experimentally
                  introduced honey bees to a Canadian grassland and measured
                  plant-pollinator interactions at varying distances from the
                  introduced hives. We found that honey bees increased the
                  network metrics of pollinator and plant functional
                  complementarity and decreased interaction evenness. However,
                  in networks constructed from just wild pollinator
                  interactions, honey bee abundance did not affect any of the
                  metrics calculated. Thus, all network structural changes to
                  the full network (including honey bee interactions) were due
                  only to honey bee-plant interactions, and not to honey bees
                  causing changes in wild pollinator-plant interactions. Given
                  widespread and increasing use of honey bees, it is important
                  to establish whether they affect wild pollinator communities.
                  Our results suggest that honey bees did not alter wild
                  pollinator foraging patterns in this system, even in a year
                  that was drier than the 20-year average.},

                  For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by
                  urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong
                  interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in
                  rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed
                  avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we
                  hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants
                  was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network
                  structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ
                  experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii)
                  was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared
                  bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control
                  forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with
                  little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities
                  of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded
                  information about nest location, and monitored nest survival.
                  For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of
                  interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation
                  resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic
                  honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of
                  interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural
                  forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival
                  increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship
                  was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest
                  overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by
                  honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network
                  shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested
                  that factors other than invasion were responsible for network
                  changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time
                  lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological
                  networks may be more challenging than anticipated.},

                  funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases.
                  Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and
                  Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience
                  and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that
                  encompass more universities. We quantified components of
                  aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size)
                  of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically
                  documented human visual preferences and investigated whether
                  these components were associated with research effort. We also
                  quantified each species' breeding range size and the number of

                  relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics,
                  familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45\% of the
                  variation in the number of published papers about each species
                  from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10\% of aesthetic
                  salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10\%,
                  and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color
                  and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top
                  10\% of breeding range size and university abundance were

                  10\% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as
                  Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater

  abstract     = {Summary A primary goal of ecology is to understand the
                  fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions
                  of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling
                  and community ecology – approach this problem differently.
                  Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs)
                  to quantify the relationship between species’ and their
                  environments without considering potential biotic
                  interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to
                  focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies,
                  use co‐occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes.
                  Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM)
                  that integrates these distinct observational approaches by
                  incorporating species co‐occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs
                  estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and
                  allow decomposition of species co‐occurrence patterns into
                  components describing shared environmental responses and
                  residual patterns of co‐occurrence. We provide a general
                  description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the
                  model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two
                  case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia.
                  Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than
                  residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there
                  were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species
                  generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to
                  the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were
                  not fully described by the environmental variables included in
                  the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar
                  environmental responses but had negative residual
                  co‐occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species
                  may not form stable assemblages despite having similar
                  environmental affinities. Environmental and residual
                  correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether
                  co‐occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or
                  other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic
                  interactions), or if important predictor variables are
                  missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions
                  of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a
                  major limitation of modelling species distributions
                  independently.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Identifying the drivers that promote unique species
                  compositions (i.e. ecological uniqueness) is crucial to
                  understanding the mechanisms underpinning diversity patterns
                  and for effective conservation planning. Environmental
                  conditions are often sampled differentially in datasets, which
                  can lead to rarer environments having unique species
                  compositions, provided that environmental differences increase
                  compositional differences. This effect, however, will be
                  undesirable when a study aims to test the direct impact of
                  environments rather than their availability. We developed an
                  approach to reduce the effects of environmental availability
                  in ecological uniqueness analyses through calculating expected
                  pairwise compositional dissimilarities for each unique
                  environmental condition. We further used simulations to assess
                  the performance of our methods by randomly generating
                  communities from two hypothetical environments with
                  non‐overlapping species pools. Additionally, we used a dataset
                  of 50 tree communities to demonstrate how environmental
                  availability could impact relationships between environmental
                  conditions and ecological uniqueness in empirical studies. Our
                  simulations revealed that uniqueness metrics based on observed
                  values are sensitive to environmental availability, while our
                  approach correctly concluded that there were no differences
                  among environments under the unbalanced design. Our analysis
                  of tree communities produced divergent conclusions between the
                  two approaches, as increasing slope reduced ecological
                  uniqueness after controlling for their low availability in the
                  dataset only. This suggests that low environmental
                  availability inflated the ecological uniqueness of sites with
                  high slope, which opposed its direct negative effects on
                  ecological uniqueness, leading to a weak relationship based on
                  observed values. To achieve a more mechanistic understanding
                  of ecological uniqueness patterns, the effects of
                  environmental availability must be considered. We recommend
                  that studies use both uncorrected and corrected analyses to
                  identify not only the direct effects of environmental
                  conditions but also the degree to which their availability
                  influences the observed relationships between ecological
                  uniqueness and environment conditions. Our approach should be
                  most necessary and applicable in unbalanced designs, which is
                  a common characteristic in empirical studies.},

  abstract     = {Upon completion of an experiment, if a trend is observed that
                  is “not quite significant,” it can be tempting to collect more
                  data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such
                  sample augmentation or “N-hacking” is condemned because it can
                  lead to an excess of false positives, which can reduce the
                  reproducibility of results. However, the scenarios used to
                  prove this rule tend to be unrealistic, assuming the addition
                  of unlimited extra samples to achieve statistical
                  significance, or doing so when results are not even close to
                  significant; an unlikely situation for most experiments
                  involving patient samples, cultured cells, or live animals. If
                  we were to examine some more realistic scenarios, could there
                  be any situations where N-hacking might be an acceptable
                  practice? This Essay aims to address this question, using
                  simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false
                  positives and to investigate whether this increase is still

               converters, projectors (loudspeakers), as well as programmable
               autonomous recording systems. Where applicable, we also discuss
               some of the pros and cons to be considered when choosing a
               particular product for a study, and the limitations that specific
               equipment may pose to the planned research. We also present
               equipment that can be used to record directly to a computer.
               Often, it may be necessary to use calibrated equipment so that
               accurate measurements can be made. We present considerations for
               calibrating the different components of the recording setup.
               Finally, we present some additional equipment used in
               biotremology to measure vibration and particle motion, and we

                  there is increasing social and legal pressure to provide
                  explanations that help the affected individuals not only to
                  understand why a prediction was output, but also how to act to
                  obtain a desired outcome. To this end, several works have
                  proposed optimization-based methods to generate nearest
                  counterfactual explanations. However, these methods are often
                  restricted to a particular subset of models (e.g., decision
                  trees or linear models) and differentiable distance functions.
                  In contrast, we build on standard theory and tools from formal

                  only in abstract terms, a discourse which ignores the

                  time to engage with these practices in the context of their
                  broader role as multifaceted academics. In the context of a
                  sector that is blighted by stress, burnout, untenable
                  workloads, and hyper-competitive pressures to produce, there
                  is a clear danger that additional expectations to engage in

                  explore how workload models currently exploit researchers by

                  increases in demands on academics. Finally, the individual and

                  those affecting economically important plants. Yet plant
                  species in cultivation represent a small and biased subset of
                  the plant kingdom. Here, we describe virus diversity and
                  abundance in 1,079 transcriptomes from species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) by analyzing
                  open-source data from the 1000 Plant Transcriptomes Initiative
                  (1KP). We identified 104 potentially novel viruses, of which
                  40\% were single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses across
                  eight orders, including members of the Hepelivirales,
                  Tymovirales, Cryppavirales, Martellivirales, and
                  Picornavirales. One-third of the newly described viruses were
                  double-stranded RNA viruses from the orders Durnavirales and
                  Ghabrivirales. The remaining were negative-sense RNA viruses
                  from the Rhabdoviridae, Aspiviridae, Yueviridae, and
                  Phenuiviridae and the newly proposed Viridisbunyaviridae. Our
                  analysis considerably expands the known host range of 13 virus
                  families to include lower plants (e.g., Benyviridae and
                  Secoviridae) and 4 virus families to include alga hosts (e.g.,
                  Tymoviridae and Chrysoviridae). More broadly, however, a
                  cophylogeny analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of
                  these families is largely driven by cross-species transmission
                  events. The discovery of the first 30-kDa movement protein in
                  a nonvascular plant suggests that the acquisition of plant
                  virus movement proteins occurred prior to the emergence of the
                  plant vascular system. Together, these data highlight that
                  numerous RNA virus families are associated with older
                  evolutionary plant lineages than previously thought and that
                  the apparent scarcity of RNA viruses found in lower plants
                  likely reflects a lack of investigation rather than their
                  absence. IMPORTANCE Our knowledge of plant viruses is mainly
                  limited to those infecting economically important host
                  species. In particular, we know little about those viruses
                  infecting basal plant lineages such as the ferns, lycophytes,
                  bryophytes, and charophytes. To expand this understanding, we
                  conducted a broad-scale viral survey of species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom. We found that basal plants
                  harbor a wide diversity of RNA viruses, including some that
                  are sufficiently divergent to likely compose a new virus
                  family. The basal plant virome revealed offers key insights
                  into the evolutionary history of core plant virus gene modules
                  and genome segments. More broadly, this work emphasizes that
                  the scarcity of viruses found in these species to date most
                  likely reflects the limited research in this area.},

                  viruses helps identify major evolutionary transitions and
                  contextualizes the emergence of viruses in new hosts. We used
                  a combination of total RNA sequencing and transcriptome data
                  mining to extend the diversity and evolutionary history of the
                  RNA virus order Articulavirales, which includes the influenza
                  viruses. We identified instances of Articulavirales in the
                  invertebrate phylum Cnidaria (including corals), constituting
                  a novel and divergent family that we provisionally named the
                  "Cnidenomoviridae." We further extended the evolutionary
                  history of the influenza virus lineage by identifying four
                  divergent, fish-associated influenza-like viruses, thereby
                  supporting the hypothesis that fish were among the first hosts
                  of influenza viruses. In addition, we substantially expanded
                  the phylogenetic diversity of quaranjaviruses and proposed
                  that this genus be reclassified as a family-the
                  "Quaranjaviridae." Within this putative family, we identified
                  a novel arachnid-infecting genus, provisionally named
                  "Cheliceravirus." Notably, we observed a close phylogenetic
                  relationship between the Crustacea- and Chelicerata-infecting
                  "Quaranjaviridae" that is inconsistent with virus-host
                  codivergence. Together, these data suggest that the
                  Articulavirales has evolved over at least 600 million years,
                  first emerging in aquatic animals. Importantly, the evolution
                  of the Articulavirales was likely shaped by multiple
                  aquatic-terrestrial transitions and substantial host jumps,
                  some of which are still observable today.},

                  been culled for decades in hopes of mitigating lethal rabies
                  infections in humans and livestock. Whether culls reduce or
                  exacerbate rabies transmission remains controversial. Using
                  Bayesian state-space models, we show that a 2-year, spatially

                  is, limits in the ability of poorer countries to adapt. This
                  paper analyses the link between income and adaptation to
                  climate events theoretically and empirically. We postulate
                  that the adaptation deficit may be due to two factors: A
                  demand effect, whereby the demand for the good “climate
                  security” increases with income, and an efficiency effect,
                  which works as a spill-over externality on the supply-side:
                  Adaptation productivity in high-income countries is enhanced
                  because of factors like better public services and stronger
                  institutions. Using panel data from the Munich Re natural
                  catastrophe database we find strong evidence for a demand
                  effect for adaptation to two climate-related extreme events,
                  tropical cyclones and floods. Evidence on the efficiency
                  effect is more equivocal. There are some indications that
                  adaptation in rich countries might be more efficient, but the
                  evidence is far from conclusive. The implication for research
                  is that better data, in particular on adaptation effort, need
                  to be collected to understand adaptation efficiency. In terms
                  of policy, we conclude that inclusive growth policies (which
                  boost adaptation demand) should be an important component of
                  international efforts to close the adaptation deficit.},

                  small to regional levels) and the scale of effect (i.e., the

                  variation in the species’ activity pattern in the networks’

                  the extrafloral nectary (EFN) of plants in order to test the
                  hypothesis that the temporal variation in the foraging
                  behavior of these animals affects the networks’ topology. In
                  order to assess the temporal effect on the interaction
                  networks, 24-hour collections divided in two 12-hour shifts
                  (day and night) were performed in 20 plots, thus totaling 288
                  collection hours over 6 months. The ant-plant interaction
                  networks presented similarity among the topological metrics
                  assessed throughout the day. Different ant species presented
                  distinct foraging times. Thus, two modules referring to the
                  day and night shifts emerged from the network and presented
                  specific species at each foraging shift. On the other hand,
                  the plants kept on providing the resource (active EFNs)
                  throughout the day. The results found in the current study
                  have shown that ecological networks keep their structures
                  constant; however, the ecological processes ruling these
                  networks can better respond to the effects caused, for
                  example, by the temporal variation in species’ activity.
                  Therefore, it is worth always taking into consideration the
                  importance of ecological processes at the time to analyze

                  Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and
                  ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods
                  to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large
                  natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as
                  gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological
                  relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to
                  result in accurate predictions of the distribution and
                  abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous
                  assessments of the theoretical advantages of these
                  methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare
                  the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to
                  identify environmental features that explain observed
                  variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged
                  tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected
                  across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient
                  boosted and linear models use similar environmental features
                  to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted
                  models found non-linear relationships and interactions that
                  are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify
                  with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient
                  boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of
                  ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much
                  greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The
                  flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional
                  model types that provide practical advantages for tick
                  surveillance and public health. The results highlight the

                  human‐to‐wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how
                  such events could threaten animal and human health. We
                  identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of
                  pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non‐human
                  primates or large, long‐lived captive animals. Relatively few
                  documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and
                  very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new
                  reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into
                  humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding
                  these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias
                  towards non‐human primates and human‐proximate mammals and the
                  possibility of systematic bias against reporting human
                  parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to
                  assess the risk of human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission. We
                  outline how researchers can collect experimental and
                  observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk
                  assessment for human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission.},

                  thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of

                  models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can
                  typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an
                  analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function

                  introduced species derive from their effects on networks of
                  species interactions4,5, but we lack a quantitative
                  understanding of the impacts of introduced species on
                  ecological networks and their biogeographic patterns globally.
                  Here we address this data gap by analysing mutualistic
                  seed-dispersal interactions from 410 local networks,
                  encompassing 24,455 unique pairwise interactions between 1,631
                  animal and 3,208 plant species. We show that species
                  introductions reduce biogeographic compartmentalization of the
                  global meta-network, in which nodes are species and links are
                  interactions observed within any local network. This
                  homogenizing effect extends across spatial scales, decreasing
                  beta diversity among local networks and modularity within

                  directly related to human environmental modifications and is
                  accelerating, having increased sevenfold over the past 75
                  years. These dynamics alter the coevolutionary environments
                  that mutualists experience6, and we find that introduced
                  species disproportionately interact with other introduced
                  species. These processes are likely to amplify biotic
                  homogenization in future ecosystems7 and may reduce the

                  propagate more quickly and exposing disparate ecosystems to
                  similar drivers. Our results highlight the importance of

                  many contexts – generalist species are “replacing” specialist
                  species. We review recent research on the concept of the

                  predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause
                  “functional homogenization” of biodiversity, and (3) such
                  homogenization may be used to measure the impact of
                  disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community
                  level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as
                  well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and

                  efforts to effectively guide conservation actions, knowing the

                  realistic expectations about the enterprise of predicting
                  changes in ecological and evolutionary observations through
                  time. We begin with an intuitive explanation of predictability
                  (that is, the extent to which predictions are possible)
                  employing an easy-to-use metric, predictive powerPP(t). To
                  illustrate the challenge of forecasting, we then show that
                  among insects, birds, fishes, and mammals (i) 50\% of the
                  populations are predictable at most one year in advance, and
                  (ii) the median one-year-ahead predictive power corresponds to
                  a sobering predictionR2of approximately 20\%. Nonetheless,
                  predictability is not an immutable property of ecological
                  systems. For example, different harvesting strategies can
                  impact the predictability of exploited populations to varying
                  degrees. Moreover, considering multivariate time series,
                  incorporating explanatory variables or accounting for time
                  trends (environmental forcing) can enhance predictability. To
                  effectively address the urgent challenge of biodiversity loss,
                  researchers and practitioners must be aware of the predictive
                  information within the available data and explore efficient

                  genotypic traits of an organism related to reproduction.
                  However, these traits-gamete type, chromosomal inheritance,
                  physiology, morphology, behavior, etc.-are not necessarily
                  coupled, and the rhetorical collapse of variation into a
                  single term elides much of the complexity inherent in sexual
                  phenotypes. We argue that consideration of "sex" as a
                  constructed category operating at multiple biological levels
                  opens up new avenues for inquiry in our study of biological
                  variation. We apply this framework to three case studies that
                  illustrate the diversity of sex variation, from decoupling
                  sexual phenotypes to the evolutionary and ecological
                  consequences of intrasexual polymorphisms. We argue that
                  instead of assuming binary sex in these systems, some may be

                  cloud, studies of sexual diversity within and across species.
                  We argue that such an expanded framework of "sex" better
                  equips us to understand evolutionary processes, and that as
                  biologists, it is incumbent upon us to push back against

                  populations can strongly impact the spread of endemic
                  pathogens. In plants, recent work has shown that
                  within-population variation in resistance can also affect the
                  transmission of foreign spillover pathogens if that resistance
                  is general. However, most hosts also possess specific
                  resistance mechanisms that provide strong defenses against
                  coevolved endemic pathogens. Here we use a modeling approach
                  to ask how antagonistic coevolution between hosts and their
                  endemic pathogen at the specific resistance locus can affect
                  the frequency of general resistance, and therefore a host’s
                  vulnerability to foreign pathogens. We develop a two-locus
                  model with variable recombination that incorporates both
                  general resistance (effective against all pathogens) and
                  specific resistance (effective against endemic pathogens
                  only). With coevolution, when pathogens can evolve to evade
                  specific resistance, we find that the regions where general
                  resistance can evolve are greatly expanded, decreasing the
                  risk of foreign pathogen invasion. Furthermore, coevolution
                  greatly expands the conditions that maintain polymorphisms at
                  both resistance loci, thereby driving greater genetic
                  diversity within host populations. This genetic diversity
                  often leads to positive correlations between host resistance
                  to foreign and endemic pathogens, similar to those observed in
                  natural populations. However, if resistance loci become
                  linked, the resistance correlations can shift to negative. If
                  we include a third linkage-modifying locus in our model, we
                  find that selection often favors complete linkage. Our model
                  demonstrates how coevolutionary dynamics with an endemic
                  pathogen can mold the resistance structure of host populations
                  in ways that affect its susceptibility to foreign pathogen
                  spillovers, and that the nature of these outcomes depends on
                  resistance costs, as well as the degree of linkage between
                  resistance genes.},

                  time-series are of different lengths. Here, we present a
                  general approach for studying the dynamic structure of such
                  interactions. Specifically, we analyse the recruitment of the
                  world's largest cod stock, the Northeast Arctic cod. Studies
                  based on data starting in the 1970-1980s indicate that this
                  stock is affected by temperature through a variety of
                  pathways. However, the value of such studies is somewhat
                  limited by the fact that they are based on a quite specific
                  ecological and climatic situation. Recently, this stock has
                  consisted of fairly young fish and the spawning stock has
                  consisted of relatively few age groups. In this study, we
                  develop a model for the effect of capelin (the cod's main
                  prey) and herring on cod recruitment since 1973. Based on this
                  model, we analyse data on cod, herring and temperature going
                  back to 1921 and find that food-web effects explain a
                  significant part of the cod recruitment variation back to
                  around 1950.},

                  whether this benefit is received by each participant node in
                  proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence.
                  This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced
                  by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by
                  applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an
                  ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here
                  we report two main results. First, nodes contribute
                  heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the
                  network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a
                  strong contributor tends to decrease overall network
                  persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor.
                  Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not
                  gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes
                  most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of
                  these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a
                  15-year time series of the interactions between designer and
                  contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As
                  with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability
                  decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases.
                  Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study
                  of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially
                  address questions about the impact of invasive species in
                  ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

                  origin present a critical threat to global population health.
                  As accelerating globalisation makes epidemics and pandemics
                  more difficult to contain, there is a need for effective
                  preventive interventions that reduce the risk of zoonotic
                  spillover events. Public policies can play a key role in
                  preventing spillover events. The aim of this review is to
                  identify and describe evaluations of public policies that
                  target the determinants of zoonotic spillover. Our approach is
                  informed by a One Health perspective, acknowledging the
                  inter-connectedness of human, animal and environmental health.
                  Methods In this systematic scoping review, we searched
                  Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021
                  using search terms combining animal health and the
                  animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and
                  zoonoses. We screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and
                  reported our process in line with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We
                  also searched relevant organisations’ websites for evaluations
                  published in the grey literature. All evaluations of public
                  policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events were
                  eligible for inclusion. We summarised key data from each
                  study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway. Results
                  Our review found 95 publications evaluating 111 policies. We
                  identified 27 unique policy options including habitat
                  protection; trade regulations; border control and quarantine
                  procedures; farm and market biosecurity measures; public
                  information campaigns; and vaccination programmes, as well as
                  multi-component programmes. These were implemented by many
                  sectors, highlighting the cross-sectoral nature of zoonotic
                  spillover prevention. Reports emphasised the importance of
                  surveillance data in both guiding prevention efforts and
                  enabling policy evaluation, as well as the importance of
                  industry and private sector actors in implementing many of
                  these policies. Thoughtful engagement with stakeholders
                  ranging from subsistence hunters and farmers to industrial
                  animal agriculture operations is key for policy success in
                  this area. Conclusion This review outlines the state of the
                  evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic
                  spillover in order to guide policy decision-making and focus
                  research efforts. Since we found that most of the existing
                  policy evaluations target ‘downstream’ determinants,
                  additional research could focus on evaluating policies
                  targeting ‘upstream’ determinants of zoonotic spillover, such
                  as land use change, and policies impacting infection intensity
                  and pathogen shedding in animal populations, such as those
                  targeting animal welfare.},

  abstract     = {Summary Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which
                  insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the
                  reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is
                  considered under threat due to reported bee declines.
                  Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators
                  and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural
                  systems, they are poorly studied. Here, we investigated the
                  relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic
                  land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local
                  plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local
                  flower visitor networks and related network architecture to
                  these local and landscape factors using structural equation
                  modelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often
                  assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to
                  pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator‐dependent
                  plant species. Overall, local land use markedly influenced
                  plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee
                  richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas.
                  Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density)
                  increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a
                  site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower
                  visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher
                  number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban
                  flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a
                  lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher
                  specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network
                  specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related
                  to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather,
                  it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance
                  and bee richness that were positively related to pollination.
                  Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant
                  and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction
                  networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and
                  pollination services to our experimental plants in urban
                  compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower
                  visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics
                  were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential
                  facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee
                  communities for pollination. A lay summary is available for

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and
                  monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses.
                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of
                  prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.},

                  (61\%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between
                  humans and animals, and 175 pathogenic species are associated
                  with diseases considered to be 'emerging'. We test the
                  hypothesis that zoonotic pathogens are more likely to be
                  associated with emerging diseases than non-emerging ones. Out

                  events, is of global concern and has the potential to cause
                  significant harm to society, as recently demonstrated by
                  COVID-19. More than 70\% of the 400 infectious diseases that
                  emerged in the past five decades have a zoonotic origin,
                  including all recent pandemics. There have been several
                  approaches used to predict the risk of spillover through some
                  of the known or suspected infectious disease emergence
                  drivers, largely using correlative approaches. Here, we
                  predict the spatial distribution of spillover risk by
                  approximating general transmission through animal and human
                  interactions. These mass action interactions are approximated
                  through the multiplication of the spatial distribution of
                  zoonotic viral diversity and human population density.
                  Although our results indicate higher risk in regions along the
                  equator and in Southeast Asia where both viral diversity and
                  human population density are high, it should be noted that
                  this is primarily a conceptual exercise. We compared our
                  spillover risk map to key factors, including the model inputs
                  of zoonotic viral diversity estimate map, human population
                  density map, and the spatial distribution of species richness.
                  Despite the limitations of this approach, this viral spillover
                  map is a step towards developing a more comprehensive
                  spillover risk prediction system to inform global monitoring.},

                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the

                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the

                  reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have
                  solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic
                  to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution
                  are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty.
                  Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and
                  probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich
                  knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent
                  complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability
                  to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and
                  explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge
                  base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

                  important activity for ecologists but when compared with
                  analysis the method of synthesis has received little
                  attention. Ecologists usually proceed intuitively and this can
                  lead to a problem in defining differences between the
                  syntheses made by different scientists. It also leads to
                  criticism from scientists favoring analytical approaches that
                  the construction of general theory is an activity that does
                  not follow the scientific method. We outline a methodology for
                  scientific inference about integrative concepts and the
                  syntheses made in constructing them and illustrate how this
                  can be applied in the development of general theory from
                  investigations into particular ecological systems. The
                  objective is to construct a causal scientific explanation.
                  This has four characteristics. (1) It defines causal and/or
                  organizational processes that describe how systems function.
                  (2) These processes are consistent – under the same conditions
                  they will produce the same effect. (3) A causal scientific
                  explanation provides general information about events of a
                  similar kind. (4) When experiments are possible then a
                  designed manipulation will produce a predictable response. The
                  essential characteristic of making synthesis to construct a
                  causal scientific explanation is that it is progressive and we
                  judge progress made by assessing the coherence of the
                  explanation using six criteria: acceptability of individual
                  propositions including that they have been tested with data,
                  consistency of concept definitions, consistency in the type of
                  concepts used in making the explanation, that ad hoc
                  propositions are not used, that there is economy in the number
                  of propositions used, that the explanation applies to broad
                  questions. We illustrate development of a causal scientific
                  explanation for the concept of long-lived pioneer tree
                  species, show how the coherence of this explanation can be
                  assessed, and how it could be improved.},

                  crucial for socioeconomic risk assessments, yet model
                  discrepancies limit their application. Here we use a
                  pattern-filtering technique to identify low-frequency changes
                  in individual members of a multi-model ensemble, to assess
                  discrepancies across models in the projected pattern and
                  magnitude of change. Specifically, we apply low-frequency
                  component analysis (LFCA) to the intensity and frequency of
                  daily precipitation extremes over land in 21 CMIP-6 models.
                  LFCA brings modest but statistically significant improvements
                  in the agreement between models in the spatial pattern of
                  projected change, particularly in scenarios with weak
                  greenhouse forcing. Moreover, we show that LFCA facilitates a
                  robust identification of the rates at which increasing
                  precipitation extremes scale with global temperature change
                  within individual ensemble members. While these rates
                  approximately match expectations from the Clausius-Clapeyron
                  relation on average across models, individual models exhibit
                  considerable and significant differences. Monte-Carlo
                  simulations indicate that these differences contribute to
                  uncertainty in the magnitude of projected change at least as
                  much as differences in the climate sensitivity. Finally, we
                  compare these scaling rates to those identified from
                  observational products, demonstrating that virtually all
                  climate models significantly underestimate the rates at which
                  increases in precipitation extremes have scaled with global
                  temperatures historically. Constraining projections with
                  observations therefore amplifies the projected intensification
                  of precipitation extremes as well as reducing the relative
                  error of their distribution.},

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal
                  Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial Cytochrome Oxidase
                  I). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that

                  and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units

                  several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful

                  tool in community ecology. Because organisms with the same
                  lifestyle can still exhibit ecological differences, it is
                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be
                  described. Here we show that networks of hosts (mammals) and
                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to
                  include in ecological networks, which we discuss in the light

                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of
                  how modular the network is) and different module compositions
                  (i.e. different groups of species forming said modules). More

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the

                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional

                  establishment of protective mutualists may be favored when
                  there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic

               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

  abstract     = {Sex is ubiquitous and variable throughout the animal kingdom.
                  Historically, scientists have used reductionist methodologies
                  that rely on a priori sex categorizations, in which two
                  discrete sexes are inextricably linked with gamete type.
                  However, this binarized operationalization does not adequately
                  reflect the diversity of sex observed in nature. This is due,
                  in part, to the fact that sex exists across many levels of
                  biological analysis, including genetic, molecular, cellular,
                  morphological, behavioral, and population levels. Furthermore,
                  the biological mechanisms governing sex are embedded in
                  complex networks that dynamically interact with other systems.
                  To produce the most accurate and scientifically rigorous work
                  examining sex in neuroendocrinology and to capture the full
                  range of sex variability and diversity present in animal
                  systems, we must critically assess the frameworks,
                  experimental designs, and analytical methods used in our
                  research. In this perspective piece, we first propose a new
                  conceptual framework to guide the integrative study of sex.
                  Then, we provide practical guidance on research approaches for
                  studying sex-associated variables, including factors to
                  consider in study design, selection of model organisms,
                  experimental methodologies, and statistical analyses. We
                  invite fellow scientists to conscientiously apply these
                  modernized approaches to advance our biological understanding
                  of sex and to encourage academically and socially responsible
                  outcomes of our work. By expanding our conceptual frameworks
                  and methodological approaches to the study of sex, we will
                  gain insight into the unique ways that sex exists across
                  levels of biological organization to produce the vast array of
                  variability and diversity observed in nature.},

                  and topography in shaping the distribution of Neanderthals
                  (Homo neanderthalensis) at different spatial scales. To this
                  end, we compiled the most comprehensive data set on the
                  distribution of this species during the Last Interglacial
                  optimum (MIS 5e) available to date. This was used to calibrate
                  a palaeo‐species distribution model, and analyse variable
                  importance at continental and local scales.LocationEurope and
                  Irano‐Turanian region (20° N to 70° N, 10° W to 70°
                  E).MethodsWe used archaeological records and palaeoclimatic
                  and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an
                  ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different
                  combinations of predictors and weighted background data. Area
                  under the curve scores computed by leave‐one‐out were used to
                  assess variable importance at the continental scale, while
                  local regression combined with recursive partition trees was
                  used to assess variable importance at the local
                  scale.ResultsAnnual rainfall and winter temperatures were the
                  most important predictors at the continental scale, while
                  topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at
                  the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were
                  observed along the Mediterranean coastlines. Mountain ranges
                  and continental plains showed low habitat suitability
                  values.Main conclusionsThe model results confirmed that
                  abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping
                  Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial. The
                  high suitability of the Mediterranean coastlines and the low
                  suitability values of most sites at the northern and eastern
                  distribution limits (Germany, Hungary, Ukraine) challenge the
                  notion of Neanderthals as a species with preference for colder
                  environments.},
