  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global
                  sustainability goals.},

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is
                  part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Geodiversity for

                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},
