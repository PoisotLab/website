                  degrees of open sharing, posing challenges for research on
                  macroecology, evolution, and public health. Here, we solve
                  this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database
                  of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in
                  One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled
                  through both reconciliation of static data sets and
                  integration of dynamically updated databases. These data
                  sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone,
                  including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and
                  higher classification; additional metadata on sampling
                  methodology and evidence strength are also available in a
                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an
                  unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global
                  virome.},

                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic
                  diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition
                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions
                  should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an
                  effective comparison and integration across domains, and for
                  assessing whether or not to use functional diversity
                  approaches for developing ecological management strategies.
                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and
                  critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To
                  this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these

                  large‐scale species interaction networks are structured.
                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and
                  taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly
                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the

                  approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to

                  momentum as a way to circumvent limitations in data volume.
                  Yet, ecological networks are challenging to predict because
                  they are typically small and sparse. Dealing with extreme
                  class imbalance is a challenge for most binary classifiers,
                  and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
                  models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple
                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

                  expanding, motivated in part by concerns around emerging
                  zoonoses. One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus
                  association data, which underpin viral macroecology and
                  zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous
                  data portals. In the present article, we propose that
                  synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to
                  characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory
                  in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open
                  database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles
                  four published data sets. We show that this offers a
                  substantially richer view of the known virome than any
                  individual source data set but also that databases such as
                  these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery
                  accelerates. We argue for a shift in practice toward the
                  development, incremental updating, and use of synthetic data
                  sets in viral ecology, to improve replicability and facilitate
                  work to predict the structure and dynamics of the global

                  on principles established by the geographic mosaic theory of
                  coevolution, we develop a quantitative, spatially explicit
                  framework for mapping the evolutionary risk of viral
                  emergence. Driven by interest in diseases like Severe Acute
                  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
                  (MERS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we examine
                  the global biogeography of bat-origin betacoronaviruses, and
                  find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of
                  risk that are distinct from the hotspots and coldspots of host
                  richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a
                  unique pool of merbecoviruses in the Neotropics, a recently
                  discovered lineage of divergent nobecoviruses in Madagascar,
                  and-most importantly-hotspots of diversification in southeast
                  Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East that correspond
                  to the site of previous zoonotic emergence events. Our
                  framework may help identify hotspots of future risk that have
                  also been previously overlooked, like West Africa and the
                  Indian subcontinent, and may more broadly help researchers

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and
                  monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses.
                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of
                  prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.},

                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the
                  world's biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity
                  within species to differences between populations,
                  communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult
                  to realize in great part because of the complexity of
                  biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of
                  theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other
                  theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic
                  diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial
                  stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to
                  consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to
                  ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require
                  theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to
                  reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have
                  solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic
                  to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution
                  are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty.
                  Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and
                  probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich
                  knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent
                  complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability
                  to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and
                  explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge
                  base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response
                  to different climate variables than do individual
                  species.LocationEurasia.Time period2000s.Major
                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to
                  β‐diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51
                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some
                  climatic variables that have no effect on species
                  distributions or dissimilarity.Main conclusionsSpecies
                  interactions capture some degree of variation that is not
                  apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this
                  system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in
                  different ways as a response to different environmental
                  factors, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss
                  the implications of this finding for the amount of information

                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets
                  for conservation purposes in unsampled locations.},

               is currently limited given the complexity of acquiring repeated
               spatial data for species interactions. Yet, recent developments
               of metawebs highlight efficient ways to first document possible
               interactions within regional species pools. Downscaling metawebs
               towards local network predictions is a promising approach to use
               current data to investigate the variation of networks across
               space. However, issues remain in how to represent the spatial
               variability and uncertainty of species interactions, especially
               for large-scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic
               framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian mammal
               metaweb and species occurrences from global databases. We
               investigated how our approach can be used to represent the
               variability of networks and communities between ecoregions in
               Canada. Species richness and interactions followed a similar
               latitudinal gradient across ecoregions but simultaneously
               identified contrasting diversity hotspots. Network motifs
               revealed additional areas of variation in network structure
               compared to species richness and number of links. Our method
               offers the potential to bring global predictions down to a more
               actionable local scale, and increases the diversity of ecological
               networks that can be projected in space.},

                  in 51 regions of the Palearctic to investigate how
