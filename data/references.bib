                  (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the full posterior
                  distribution of a state-space model. It does so by executing
                  Gibbs sampling steps on an extended target distribution
                  defined on the space of the auxiliary variables generated by
                  an interacting particle system. This paper makes the following
                  contributions to the theoretical study of this algorithm.
                  Firstly, we present a coupling construction between two
                  particle Gibbs updates from different starting points and we
                  show that the coupling probability may be made arbitrarily
                  close to one by increasing the number of particles. We obtain
                  as a direct corollary that the particle Gibbs kernel is
                  uniformly ergodic. Secondly, we show how the inclusion of an
                  additional Gibbs sampling step that reselects the ancestors of
                  the particle Gibbs' extended target distribution, which is a
                  popular approach in practice to improve mixing, does indeed
                  yield a theoretically more efficient algorithm as measured by
                  the asymptotic variance. Thirdly, we extend particle Gibbs to
                  work with lower variance resampling schemes. A detailed
                  numerical study is provided to demonstrate the efficiency of
                  particle Gibbs and the proposed variants.}

                  is an important practical problem. We want to explain
                  individual predictions from a complex machine learning model
                  by learning simple, interpretable explanations. Shapley values
                  is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose.
                  The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable
                  theoretical properties, and can in principle handle any
                  predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient
                  approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like
                  several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the
                  features are independent, which may give very wrong
                  explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model
                  is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the Kernel
                  SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several
                  examples of linear and non-linear models with various degrees

                  proposed optimization-based methods to generate nearest

              Individual recourse pertains to the problem of providing an

                  It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying
                  naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer
                  vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement
                  learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to
                  provide the reader a working understanding of conformal
                  prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty
                  quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We
                  lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of
                  conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex
                  machine learning tasks involving structured outputs,
                  distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that
                  abstain, and more. Throughout, there are many explanatory
                  illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python. With each
                  code sample comes a Jupyter notebook implementing the method
                  on a real-data example; the notebooks can be accessed and
                  easily run using our codebase.},

              high-quality and realistic images from users' prompts. Not limited

              generative models, and consequently, a tremendous amount of
              generated images have been shared on the Internet. Meanwhile,
              today's success of deep learning in the computer vision field owes
              a lot to images collected from the Internet. These trends lead us
              to a research question: "\textbf{will such generated images impact
              the quality of future datasets and the performance of computer
              vision models positively or negatively?}" This paper empirically
              answers this question by simulating contamination. Namely, we
              generate ImageNet-scale and COCO-scale datasets using a
              state-of-the-art generative model and evaluate models trained with
              "contaminated" datasets on various tasks, including image
              classification and image generation. Throughout experiments, we
              conclude that generated images negatively affect downstream
              performance, while the significance depends on tasks and the
              amount of generated images. The generated datasets and the codes
              for experiments will be publicly released for future research.

                  Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we
                  communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation,
                  in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI
                  models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new
                  generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI
                  regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their
                  capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal
                  part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct
                  regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and
                  (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to
                  capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by
                  differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers,
                  professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients
                  of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these
                  different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies
                  to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the
                  benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other
                  direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained
                  models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations
                  concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk
                  obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the
                  AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on
                  concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model
                  itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding
                  transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination
                  provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers.
                  Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA content moderation rules
                  should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and
                  action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers. In all areas,
                  regulators and lawmakers need to act fast to keep track with

                  architectures grow more complex. Following the path of
                  traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers
                  have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and

                  studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to
                  guide software engineers towards better package maintenance
                  and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of

                  In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of
                  PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most
                  popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices

                  GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided

                  by any optimality criterion (e.g., maximum likelihood) is an
                  NP-hard problem, propelling the development of myriad
                  heuristic approaches. Yet, these heuristics often lack a
                  systematic means of uniformly sampling random trees or
                  effectively exploring a tree space that grows factorially,
                  which are crucial to optimisation problems such as machine
                  learning. Accordingly, we present Phylo2Vec, a new
                  parsimonious representation of a phylogenetic tree. Phylo2Vec
                  maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to an integer vector of

                  events, is of global concern and has the potential to cause
                  significant harm to society, as recently demonstrated by
                  COVID-19. More than 70\% of the 400 infectious diseases that
                  emerged in the past five decades have a zoonotic origin,
                  including all recent pandemics. There have been several

                  of the known or suspected infectious disease emergence
                  drivers, largely using correlative approaches. Here, we

                  explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly
                  computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant
                  information from images for science and conservation. Yet most
                  of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task
                  and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions,
                  contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal
                  biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach
                  this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and
                  most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then
                  develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life,
                  leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by
                  TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of
                  plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of

                  outperforms existing baselines (by 17\% to 20\% absolute).

                  and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a
                  study that systematically compared models for a university
                  community, which has a much smaller but more connected
                  population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic
                  agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a
                  model based on ordinary differential equations. All three
                  models represented the disease progression with the same
                  susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We
                  created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000
                  students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for
                  combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact
                  tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask
                  wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. We used
                  parameter values from other epidemiological studies and

                  approaches to each other using a synthetic population. For
                  each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of
                  persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. We
                  evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and
                  evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The
                  agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment
                  model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to
                  and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary
                  differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The
                  ABM's computation time was much greater than the other two
                  models' computation time. The DCM captured some of the
                  dynamics that were present in the ABM's predictions and, like
                  those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing

                  present a solvable example of such a feedback mechanism in a
                  generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamical system. Beginning with a
                  community of species interacting on a network with arbitrary
                  degree distribution, we provide an analytical framework from
                  which properties of the eventual `surviving community' can be
                  derived. We find that highly-connected species are less likely
                  to survive than their poorly connected counterparts, which
                  skews the eventual degree distribution towards a preponderance
                  of species with low degree, a pattern commonly observed in
                  real ecosystems. Further, the average abundance of the
                  neighbours of a species in the surviving community is lower
                  than the community average (reminiscent of the famed
                  friendship paradox). Finally, we show that correlations emerge
                  between the connectivity of a species and its interactions
                  with its neighbours. More precisely, we find that
                  highly-connected species tend to benefit from their neighbours
                  more than their neighbours benefit from them. These
                  correlations are not present in the initial pool of species

                  the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival
                  of a focal species in complex environments. However,
                  extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal
                  networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions limiting
                  their scope. Here, we develop a multilayer network model of
                  competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how
                  spatially structured environments impact species coexistence
                  and ecosystem stability. We show that homogeneous environments
                  always lead to monodominance unless all species' fitness
                  parameters are in an exact trade-off. However, this precise
                  fine-tuning does not guarantee coexistence in generic
                  heterogeneous environments. By introducing general spatial
                  disorder in the model, we solve it exactly in the mean-field
                  limit, finding that stable coexistence becomes possible in the
                  presence of strong disorder. Crucially, coexistence is
                  supported by the spontaneous localization of species through
                  the emergence of ecological niches. Our results remain
                  qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where
                  topological features can improve species coexistence. Finally,
                  we employ our model to study how correlated disorder promotes
                  spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and
                  riverine landscapes. Our work provides a novel framework to
                  understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in

                  equations describing growth of interacting ecological species.
                  This model has gained renewed interest in the context of
                  random interaction networks. One of the debated questions is
                  understanding how the number of species in the system, $n$,
                  influences the stability of the model. Robert May demonstrated
                  that large systems become unstable, unless species-species
                  interactions vanish. This outcome has frequently been
                  interpreted as a universal phenomenon and summarised as "large
                  systems are unstable". However, May's results were performed
                  on a specific type of graphs (Erdős-Rényi), whereas we explore
                  a different class of networks and we show that the competitive
                  Lotka-Volterra system maintains stability even in the limit of
                  large $n$, despite non-vanishing interaction strength. We
                  establish a lower bound on the interspecific interaction
                  strength, formulated in terms of the maximum and minimum
                  degrees of the ecological network, rather than being dependent
                  upon the network's size. For values below this threshold,
                  coexistence of all species is attained in the asymptotic
                  limit. In other words, the outlier nodes with large degree
                  cause instability, rather than the large number of species in
                  the system. Our result refines May's bound, by showing that
                  the type of network model is relevant and can lead to

              derive a distance measure based on weighted symbol (mis)matches.
              Local alignment allows poems to be clustered according to emergent
              properties of their underlying prosodic patterns. We evaluate
              method performance on a meter recognition tasks against strong
              baselines and show its potential for cross-lingual and historical
              research using three short case studies: 1) mutations in
              quantitative meter in classical Latin, 2) European diffusion of
              the Renaissance hendecasyllable, and 3) comparative alignment of
              modern meters in 18--19th century Czech, German and Russian. We

  abstract     = {A fundamental problem associated with the task of network
                  reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in
                  determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner
                  that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network
                  with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status
                  quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization
                  combined with cross-validation. As we demonstrate, besides its
                  high computational cost, this commonplace approach
                  unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight
                  "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the
                  bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which
                  often results in substantial overfitting even after
                  cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative
                  nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical
                  Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not
                  rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach
                  follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and
                  uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most
                  compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without
                  requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our
                  approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a
                  single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a
                  principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used
                  with a large variety of generative models, without requiring
                  the number of edges to be known in advance. We also
                  demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased
                  accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and
                  empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with
                  the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial
                  communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in
                  the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how
                  the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of
                  interventions in the system.},

                  release of ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre‐trained Transformer)
                  by OpenAI on November 30, 2022 has opened up new possibilities
                  for the use of chatbot services in ecological research and
                  education. In this perspective article, we address associated
                  contemporary topics including the use of chatbot services in
                  ecology education and academic writing, the application of AI
                  in ecology, the potential environmental impact, and ethical
                  considerations of using such services. Several logistical,
                  ethical and environmental factors were identified that should
                  be considered in the context of ecological research. We argue
                  that ChatGPT can help reduce the workload of researchers,
                  generate new insights and ideas, and serve as a personal
                  instructor and assistant for students. While we show how AI
                  chatbots have the potential to be useful assets for
                  ecologists, several challenges arose. AI in ecological
                  research includes the limited ability of AI algorithms to
                  capture complexity and nuance, the dependence of AI models on
                  data quality, and ethical concerns about the use of AI in
                  research. The construction and operation of such services also
                  have potential environmental impacts but may also provide
                  environmental benefits in comparison with other conventional
                  approaches, all of which should be evaluated. Despite these
                  limitations and challenges, we consider that the use of AI can
                  be a valuable tool in ecological research and could enhance
                  the speed and efficiency of research by automating certain
                  tasks (e.g. data collection and management) and analyzing
                  large amounts of data. However, we emphasize the importance of
                  taking a responsible, sustainable and transparent approach to
                  using chatbot services and AI in ecological research and
                  education, while remaining mindful of the potential impact on

                  underlying biodiversity response to, or effects on, the
                  environment. Nevertheless, the Raunkiæran shortfall—the dearth
                  of knowledge on species traits and their
                  functionality—presents a challenge in the application of these
                  approaches. We conducted a systematic review to investigate
                  the trends and gaps in trait‐based animal ecology in terms of
                  taxonomic resolution, trait selection, ecosystem type, and
                  geographical region. In addition, we suggest a set of crucial
                  steps to guide trait selection and aid future research to
                  conduct within and cross‐taxon comparisons. We identified 1655
                  articles using virtually all animal groups published from 1999
                  to 2020. Studies were concentrated in vertebrates, terrestrial
                  habitats, the Palearctic realm, and mostly investigated
                  trophic and habitat dimensions. Additionally, they focused on
                  response traits (79.4\%) and largely ignored intraspecific
                  variation (94.6\%). Almost 36\% of the data sets did not
                  provide the rationale behind the selection of morphological
                  traits. The main limitations of trait‐based animal ecology
                  were the use of trait averages and a rare inclusion of
                  intraspecific variability. Nearly one‐fifth of the studies
                  based only on response traits conclude that trait diversity
                  impacts ecosystem processes or services without justifying the
                  connection between them or measuring them. We propose a guide
                  for standardizing trait collection that includes the
                  following: (i) determining the type of trait and the mechanism
                  linking the trait to the environment, ecosystem, or the
                  correlation between the environment, trait, and ecosystem,
                  (ii) using a “periodic table of niches” to select the
                  appropriate niche dimension to support a mechanistic trait
                  selection, and (iii) selecting the relevant traits for each
                  retained niche dimension. By addressing these gaps,
                  trait‐based animal ecology can become more predictive. This
                  implies that future research will likely focus on
                  collaborating to understand how environmental changes impact
                  animals and their capacity to provide ecosystem services and

                  with its implementation, particularly for new team members.
                  The challenges of large projects often weigh on the most
                  vulnerable members of a team: trainees, including
                  undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral
                  researchers. Trainees on big projects have to navigate their
                  role on the team, with learning project policies, procedures,
                  and goals, all while also training in key scientific tasks
                  such as co-authoring papers. To address these challenges, we
                  created and participated in a project-specific, graduate-level
                  team science course. The purposes of this course were to: (1)

                  trainees' understanding of how big projects operate, and (3)

                  dovetailed with the overall project. Additionally, trainees
                  received training regarding: (1) diversity, equity \&
                  inclusion, (2) giving and receiving feedback, and (3)

                  exclusion of plant species by determining which plants receive
                  conspecific pollen. A key question is whether realistic
                  pollinator foraging behavior promotes coexistence or exclusion
                  of plant species. We use a simulation model to understand how
                  pollinator foraging behavior impacts the coexistence dynamics
                  of pollen-limited plants. To determine whether pollinators are
                  likely to provide a biologically important coexistence
                  mechanism, we compare our results to bee foraging data from
                  the literature and from a novel experimental analysis. Model
                  results indicate that strong specialization at the level of
                  individual foraging paths is required to promote coexistence.
                  However, few empirical studies have robustly quantified
                  within-bout specialization. Species-level data suggest that
                  foraging behavior is sufficient to permit pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence in species-poor plant communities and possibly in
                  diverse communities where congeneric plants co-occur. Our
                  experiments using bumblebees show that individual-level
                  specialization does exist, but not at levels sufficient to
                  substantially impact coexistence dynamics. The literature on
                  specialization within natural foraging paths suffers from key
                  limitations, but overall suggests that pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence should be rare in diverse plant communities.},

                  Information can be extracted from the properties of time
                  series for tasks such as classification (e.g., assigning
                  species to individual bird calls); clustering (e.g.,
                  clustering similar responses in population dynamics to abrupt
                  changes in the environment or management interventions);
                  prediction (e.g., accuracy of model predictions to original
                  time series data); and anomaly detection (e.g., detecting
                  possible catastrophic events from population time series).
                  These common tasks in ecological research all rely on the
                  notion of (dis-) similarity, which can be determined using
                  distance measures. A plethora of distance measures have been
                  described, predominantly in the computer and information
                  sciences, but many have not been introduced to ecologists.
                  Furthermore, little is known about how to select appropriate
                  distance measures for time-series-related tasks. Therefore,
                  many potential applications remain unexplored. Here, we
                  describe 16 properties of distance measures that are likely to
                  be of importance to a variety of ecological questions
                  involving time series. We then test 42 distance measures for
                  each property and use the results to develop an objective
                  method to select appropriate distance measures for any task
                  and ecological dataset. We demonstrate our selection method by
                  applying it to a set of real-world data on breeding bird
                  populations in the UK and discuss other potential applications
                  for distance measures, along with associated technical issues
                  common in ecology. Our real-world population trends exhibit a
                  common challenge for time series comparisons: a high level of
                  stochasticity. We demonstrate two different ways of overcoming
                  this challenge, first by selecting distance measures with
                  properties that make them well suited to comparing noisy time
                  series and second by applying a smoothing algorithm before
                  selecting appropriate distance measures. In both cases, the
                  distance measures chosen through our selection method are not
                  only fit-for-purpose but are consistent in their rankings of
                  the population trends. The results of our study should lead to
                  an improved understanding of, and greater scope for, the use

  abstract     = {Evolvability is the capacity of a population to generate
                  heritable variation that can be acted upon by natural
                  selection. This ability influences the adaptations and fitness
                  of individual organisms. By viewing this capacity as a trait,
                  evolvability is subject to natural selection and thus plays a
                  critical role in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Understanding this
                  role provides insight into how species respond to changes in
                  their environment and how species coexistence can arise and be
                  maintained. Here, we create a G-function model of competing
                  species, each with a different evolvability. We analyze
                  population and strategy (= heritable phenotype) dynamics of
                  the two populations under clade initiation (when species are
                  introduced into a population), evolutionary tracking
                  (constant, small changes in the environment), adaptive
                  radiation (availability of multiple ecological niches), and
                  evolutionary rescue (extreme environmental disturbances). We
                  find that when species are far from an eco-evolutionary
                  equilibrium, faster-evolving species reach higher population
                  sizes, and when species are close to an equilibrium,
                  slower-evolving species are more successful. Frequent, minor
                  environmental changes promote the extinction of species with
                  small population sizes, regardless of their evolvability. When
                  several niches are available for a species to occupy,
                  coexistence is possible, though slower-evolving species
                  perform slightly better than faster-evolving ones due to the
                  well-recognized inherent cost of evolvability. Finally,
                  disrupting the environment at intermediate frequencies can
                  result in coexistence with cyclical population dynamics of
                  species with different rates of evolution.},

                  datasets, making it challenging to compile and compare trait
                  information across different groups. For plants, the TRY
                  database has been an unwavering success for those ecologists
                  interested in addressing how plant traits influence a wide
                  variety of processes and patterns, but the same is not true
                  for most animal taxonomic groups. Here, we introduce
                  ZooTraits, a Shiny app designed to help users explore and
                  obtain animal trait data for research in ecology and
                  evolution. ZooTraits was developed to tackle the challenge of
                  finding in a single site information of multiple trait
                  datasets and facilitating access to traits by providing an
                  easy‐to‐use, open‐source platform. This app combines datasets
                  centralized in the Open Trait Network, raw data from the
                  AnimalTraits database, and trait information for animals
                  compiled by Gonçalves‐Souza et al. (2023, Ecology and
                  Evolution 13, e10016). Importantly, the ZooTraits app can be
                  accessed freely and provides a user‐friendly interface through
                  three functionalities that will allow users to easily
                  visualize, compare, download, and upload trait data across the
                  animal tree of life—ExploreTrait, FeedTrait, and GetTrait. By
                  using ExploreTrait and GetTrait, users can explore, compare,
                  and extract 3954 trait records from 23,394 species centralized
                  in the Open Traits Network, and trait data for ~2000 species
                  from the AnimalTraits database. The app summarizes trait
                  information for numerous taxonomic groups within the Animal
                  Kingdom, encompassing data from diverse aquatic and
                  terrestrial ecosystems and various geographic regions
                  worldwide. Moreover, ZooTraits enables researchers to upload
                  trait information, serving as a hub for a continually
                  expanding global trait database. By promoting the
                  centralization of trait datasets and offering a platform for
                  data sharing, ZooTraits is facilitating advancements in
                  trait‐based ecological and evolutionary studies. We hope that
                  other trait databases will evolve to mirror the approach we
                  have outlined here.},

                  effects of another species on a shared host, represent a
                  common type of species interaction in natural communities, yet
                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the
                  invaded patch exceeding a threshold, highlighting the likely
                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional
                  coexistence is in fact possible in an explicitly spatial
                  system and that, under some circumstances, the mutualist
                  population can exclude the enemy. More broadly, the
                  establishment of protective mutualists may be favored when
                  there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic
                  symbionts, such as vertical transmission or additional direct
                  benefits to hosts.},

                  threshold selection methods (maxSSS and maxF pb) and examine
                  the effectiveness of the threshold-based prevalence estimation
                  approach. Six virtual species with varying prevalence were
                  simulated within a real landscape in southeastern Australia.
                  Presence-only models were built with DOMAIN, generalized
                  linear model, Maxent, and Random Forest. Thresholds were
                  selected with two methods maxSSS and maxF pb with four
                  presence-only datasets with different ratios of the number of
                  known presences to the number of random points (KP-RP ratio).
                  Sensitivity, specificity, true skill statistic, and F measure
                  were used to evaluate the performance of the results. Species
                  prevalence was estimated as the ratio of the number of
                  predicted presences to the total number of points in the
                  evaluation dataset. Thresholds selected with maxF pb varied as
                  the KP-RP ratio of the threshold selection datasets changed.
                  Datasets with the KP-RP ratio around 1 generally produced
                  better results than scores distant from 1. Results produced by
                  We conclude that maxFpb had specificity too low for very
                  common species using Random Forest and Maxent models. In
                  contrast, maxSSS produced consistent results whichever dataset
                  was used. The estimation of prevalence was almost always
                  biased, and the bias was very large for DOMAIN and Random
                  Forest predictions. We conclude that maxF pb is affected by
                  the KP-RP ratio of the threshold selection datasets, but
                  maxSSS is almost unaffected by this ratio. Unbiased
                  estimations of prevalence are difficult to be determined using
                  the threshold-based approach.},

                  machine learning to examine drivers of viral diversity in

                  type, and predict undetected viral carriers. Our results

                  group sizes carry more viruses overall. Life span was a

                  African forests before expanding into domestic habitats and
                  spreading to other continents. Despite a well-studied
                  evolutionary history, how this species initially moved into
                  human settlements in Africa remains unclear. During this
                  initial habitat transition, African Ae. aegypti switched their
                  larval sites from natural water containers like tree holes to
                  artificial containers like clay pots. Little is known about
                  how these natural versus artificial containers differ in their
                  characteristics. Filling this knowledge gap could provide
                  valuable information for studying the evolution of Ae. aegypti
                  associated with larval habitat changes. As an initial effort,
                  in this study, we characterized the microenvironments of Ae.
                  aegypti larval sites in forest and domestic habitats in two
                  African localities: La Lopé, Gabon, and Rabai, Kenya.
                  Specifically, we measured the physical characteristics,
                  microbial density, bacterial composition, and volatile
                  chemical profiles of multiple larval sites. In both
                  localities, comparisons between natural containers in the
                  forests and artificial containers in the villages revealed
                  significantly different microenvironments. We next examined
                  whether the between-habitat differences in larval site
                  microenvironments lead to differences in oviposition, a key
                  behavior affecting larval distribution. Forest Ae. aegypti
                  readily accepted the artificial containers we placed in the
                  forests. Laboratory choice experiments also did not find
                  distinct oviposition preferences between forest and village
                  Ae. aegypti colonies. These results suggested that African Ae.
                  aegypti are likely generalists in their larval site choices.
                  This flexibility to accept various containers with a wide
                  range of physical, microbial, and chemical conditions might
                  allow Ae. aegypti to use human-stored water as fallback larval
                  sites during dry seasons, which is hypothesized to have
                  initiated the domestic evolution of Ae. aegypti.},

                  group to consider the effects of fragmentation, because they
                  are abundant in the tropics, serve important ecological roles,
                  and harbor many parasites. Nevertheless, research on the
                  effects of fragmentation on bat ectoparasites is still
                  limited. To help guide ongoing and future research efforts,
                  this study had two objectives: (1) conduct a gap analysis to
                  characterize the state of currently available research on
                  fragmentation effects on bat ectoparasites and (2) conduct a
                  preliminary meta-analysis to identify current trends. We
                  systematically highlighted several research gaps: Studies
                  comparing the effects of fragmented versus continuous forests
                  on ectoparasites are limited and have primarily been conducted
                  in the Neotropics, with a focus on bats in the superfamily
                  Noctilionidea (especially frugivorous phyllostomids). Our
                  preliminary meta-analysis suggested that ectoparasite
                  prevalence (but not the mean or variance in intensity) was
                  higher in fragments than in continuous forests. Moreover,
                  prevalence increased with increasing roost duration, and mean
                  intensity was higher for bats with higher wing aspect ratios.
                  Intensity variance was affected by an interaction between
                  forest type and wing aspect ratio, such that variance
                  increased for bats with high-wing aspect ratios in continuous
                  forests but decreased in fragments. These results suggest that
                  fragmentation can shape aspects of bat ectoparasitism and
                  could have implications for the ecology, health, and
                  conservation of bats in fragmented landscapes. However,
                  existing research gaps could bias our current understanding of
                  habitat change and bat health, and future research should thus
                  investigate these effects in the Paleotropics and with other
                  bat families.},

  abstract     = {AbstractEcological networks describe the interactions between
                  different species, informing us how they rely on one another
                  for food, pollination, and survival. If a species in an
                  ecosystem is under threat of extinction, it can affect other
                  species in the system and possibly result in their secondary
                  extinction as well. Understanding how (primary) extinctions
                  cause secondary extinctions on ecological networks has been
                  considered previously using computational methods. However,
                  these methods do not provide an explanation for the properties
                  that make ecological networks robust, and they can be
                  computationally expensive. We develop a new analytic model for
                  predicting secondary extinctions that requires no stochastic
                  simulation. Our model can predict secondary extinctions when
                  primary extinctions occur at random or due to some targeting
                  based on the number of links per species or risk of
                  extinction, and can be applied to an ecological network of any
                  number of layers. Using our model, we consider how false
                  negatives and positives in network data affect predictions for
                  network robustness. We have also extended the model to predict
                  scenarios in which secondary extinctions occur once species
                  lose a certain percentage of interaction strength, and to
                  model the loss of interactions as opposed to just species
                  extinction. From our model, it is possible to derive new
                  analytic results such as how ecological networks are most
                  robust when secondary species are of equal degree.
                  Additionally, we show that both specialization and
                  generalization in the distribution of interaction strength can
                  be advantageous for network robustness, depending upon the
                  extinction scenario being considered.},

                  developed by the Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) for
                  the common formatting and archiving of ecological forecasts
                  and the metadata associated with these forecasts. Such open
                  standards are intended to promote interoperability and
                  facilitate forecast communication, distribution, validation,
                  and synthesis. For output files, we first describe the
                  convention conceptually in terms of global attributes,
                  forecast dimensions, forecasted variables, and ancillary
                  indicator variables. We then illustrate the application of
                  this convention to the two file formats that are currently
                  preferred by the EFI, netCDF (network common data form), and
                  comma‐separated values (CSV), but note that the convention is
                  extensible to future formats. For metadata, EFI's convention
                  identifies a subset of conventional metadata variables that
                  are required (e.g., temporal resolution and output variables)
                  but focuses on developing a framework for storing information
                  about forecast uncertainty propagation, data assimilation, and
                  model complexity, which aims to facilitate cross‐forecast
                  synthesis. The initial application of this convention expands
                  upon the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), a commonly used
                  metadata standard in ecology. To facilitate community
                  adoption, we also provide a Github repository containing a
                  metadata validator tool and several vignettes in R and Python
                  on how to both write and read in the EFI standard. Lastly, we
                  provide guidance on forecast archiving, making an important
                  distinction between short‐term dissemination and long‐term
                  forecast archiving, while also touching on the archiving of
                  code and workflows. Overall, the EFI convention is a living
                  document that can continue to evolve over time through an open
                  community process.},

                  environmental space are removed from the modeling procedure,
                  is an approach often used to address these biases. However,
                  thinning occurrence data can also negatively affect SDM
                  performance, given that the benefits of removing spatial
                  biases might be outweighed by the detrimental effects of data
                  loss caused by this approach. We used real and virtual species
                  to evaluate how spatial and environmental thinning affected
                  different performance metrics of four SDM methods. The
                  occurrence data of virtual species were sampled randomly,
                  evenly spaced, and clustered in the geographic space to
                  simulate different types of spatial biases, and several
                  spatial and environmental thinning distances were used to thin
                  the occurrence data. Null datasets were also generated for
                  each thinning distance where we randomly removed the same
                  number of occurrences by a thinning distance and compared the
                  results of the thinned and null datasets. We found that
                  spatially or environmentally thinned occurrence data is no
                  better than randomly removing them, given that thinned
                  datasets performed similarly to null datasets. Specifically,
                  spatial and environmental thinning led to a general decrease
                  in model performances across all SDM methods. These results
                  were observed for real and virtual species, were positively
                  associated with thinning distance, and were consistent across
                  the different types of spatial biases. Our results suggest
                  that thinning occurrence data usually fails to improve SDM
                  performance and that the use of thinning approaches when
                  modeling species distributions should be considered carefully.},

                  infectious diseases, which can be prevented or mitigated by
                  studying host–parasite interactions, among other measures.
                  Bats and their ectoparasitic flies of the families Streblidae
                  and Nycteribiidae are an excellent study model but, so far,
                  our knowledge has been restricted to fragmented records at a
                  local scale. To help boost research, we assembled a data set
                  of bat–fly interactions from 174 studies published between
                  1904 and 2022 plus three original data sets. Altogether, these
                  studies were carried out at 650 sites in the Neotropics,
                  mainly distributed in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, southern USA,
                  and Colombia, among other countries. In total, our data set
                  contains 3984 interaction records between 237 bat species and
                  255 fly species. The bat species with the largest number of
                  recorded interactions were Carollia perspicillata (357),
                  Artibeus jamaicensis (263), and Artibeus lituratus (228). The
                  fly species with the largest number of recorded interactions
                  were Trichobius joblingi (256), Megistopoda aranea (235), and
                  Megistopoda proxima (215). The interaction data were
                  extracted, filtered, taxonomically harmonized, and made
                  available in a tidy format together with linked data on bat
                  population, fly population, study reference, sampling methods
                  and geographic information from the study sites. This
                  interconnected structure enables the expansion of information
                  for each interaction record, encompassing where and how each
                  interaction occurred, as well as the number of bats and flies
                  involved. We expect BatFly to open new avenues for research
                  focused on different levels of ecological organization and
                  spatial scales. It will help consolidate knowledge about
                  ecological specialization, resource distribution, pathogen
                  transmission, and the drivers of parasite prevalence over a
                  broad spatial range. It may also help to answer key questions
                  such as: Are there differences in fly prevalence or mean
                  infestation across Neotropical ecoregions? What ecological
                  drivers explain those differences? How do specialization
                  patterns vary among fly species in the Neotropics?
                  Furthermore, we expect BatFly to inspire research aimed at
                  understanding how climate and land‐use changes may impact
                  host–parasite interactions and disease outbreaks. This kind of

                  activities represent one of the greatest causes of
                  biodiversity loss. However, the effects of habitat loss and
                  fragmentation are not felt equally among species. Here, we
                  examined how habitat loss influenced the diversity and
                  abundance of species from different trophic levels, with
                  different traits, by taking advantage of an inadvertent
                  experiment that created habitat islands from a once continuous
                  forest via the creation of the Thousand Island Lake, a large
                  reservoir in China. On 28 of these islands with more than a
                  9000‐fold difference in their area (0.12–1154 ha), we sampled
                  plants, herbivorous insects, and predatory insects using
                  effort‐controlled sampling and analyses. This allowed us to
                  discern whether any observed differences in species diversity
                  were due to passive sampling alone or to demographic effects
                  that disproportionately influenced some species relative to
                  others. We found that while most metrics of sampling
                  effort‐controlled diversity increased with island area, the
                  strength of the effect was exacerbated for species in higher
                  trophic levels. When we more explicitly examined differences
                  in species composition among islands, we found that the
                  pairwise difference in species composition among islands was
                  dominated by species turnover but that nestedness increased
                  with differences in island area, indicating that some species
                  are more likely to be absent from smaller islands.
                  Furthermore, by examining trends of several dispersal‐related
                  traits of species, we found that species with lower dispersal
                  propensity tended to be those that were lost from smaller
                  islands, which was observed for herbivorous and predatory
                  insects. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating
                  within‐patch demographic effects, as well as the taxa and
                  traits of species when understanding the influence of habitat
                  loss on biodiversity.},

                  While a variety of local genetic adaptations exist within our
                  species, it seems certain that the same basic genetic
                  endowment produces arctic foraging, tropical horticulture, and
                  desert pastoralism, a constellation that represents a greater
                  range of subsistence behavior than the rest of the Primate
                  Order combined. The behavioral adaptations that explain the
                  immense success of our species are cultural in the sense that
                  they are transmitted among individuals by social learning and
                  have accumulated over generations. Understanding how and when

                  environment facilitate zoonotic spillover—the transmission of
                  pathogens from animals to humans. Narratives that cast modern
                  humans as exogenous and disruptive forces that encroach upon
                  “natural” disease systems limit our understanding of human
                  drivers of disease. This review leverages theory from
                  evolutionary anthropology that situates humans as functional
                  components of disease ecologies, to argue that human adaptive
                  strategies to resource acquisition shape predictable patterns
                  of high‐risk human–animal interactions, (2) humans construct
                  ecological processes that facilitate spillover, and (3)
                  contemporary patterns of epidemiological risk are emergent
                  properties of interactions between human foraging ecology and
                  niche construction. In turn, disease ecology serves as an
                  important vehicle to link what some cast as opposing bodies of
                  theory in human ecology. Disease control measures should
                  consider human drivers of disease as rational, adaptive, and
                  dynamic and capitalize on our capacity to influence ecological
                  processes to mitigate risk.},

                  pressures, affecting the provision of ecosystem services.
                  Therefore, it is increasingly important that we can quantify
                  and manage ecosystem services to maintain human well‐being.
                  Many ecosystem services are underpinned by ecosystem functions
                  and processes that are driven by interspecific ecological
                  interactions. Humans then benefit from ecosystem services
                  through socio‐ecological interactions. Therefore, interaction
                  network approaches can provide a unique understanding of
                  ecosystem service flows. In this paper, we assess the current
                  interface between network ecology and ecosystem services,
                  before exploring how work linking these two fields could be
                  enhanced. We emphasise the value of network approaches and
                  explore network methods to improve the assessment and

                  to efficiently mitigate further biodiversity loss and the
                  associated loss of ecosystem services are at an all‐time high.
                  So far, however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused
                  on structural and compositional features of ecosystems despite
                  growing evidence that ecosystem functions are key to
                  elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity
                  generates services to humanity. This monitoring gap can be
                  traced to the current lack of consensus on what exactly
                  ecosystem functions are and how to track them at scales beyond
                  the site level. This contribution aims to advance the
                  development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by
                  proposing the adoption of a set of definitions and a typology

                  and marine managers, remote sensing specialists and policy

                  addition to explaining the different components of BART using
                  simple examples, we also discuss a framework, the General BART
                  model that unifies some of the recent BART extensions,
                  including semiparametric models, correlated outcomes, and

                  in our quest to understand better climate change and its
                  impacts, we first need to critically review the strengths and
                  weaknesses of local knowledge of climate change and the
                  potential complementarity with scientific knowledge. With this
                  aim, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of
                  published peer-reviewed documents reporting local indicators
                  of climate change (including both local observations of
                  climate change and observed impacts on the biophysical and the
                  social systems). Overall, primary data on the topic are not
                  abundant, the methodological development is incipient, and the
                  geographical extent is unbalanced. On the 98 case studies
                  documented, we recorded the mention of 746 local indicators of
                  climate change, mostly corresponding to local observations of
                  climate change (40\%), but also to observed impacts on the
                  physical (23\%), the biological (19\%), and the socioeconomic
                  (18\%) systems. Our results suggest that, even if local
                  observations of climate change are the most frequently
                  reported type of change, the rich and fine-grained knowledge
                  in relation to impacts on biophysical systems could provide
                  more original contributions to our understanding of climate

                  maladaptation and provides some specific case studies—in the
                  Maldives, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Bangladesh—to advance
                  the field by offering an improved conceptual understanding and
                  more practice‐oriented insights. It notably highlights four
                  main dimensions to assess the risk of maladaptation, that is,
                  process, multiple drivers, temporal scales, and spatial
                  scales. It also describes three examples of frameworks—the
                  Pathways, the Precautionary, and the Assessment
                  frameworks—that can help capture the risk of maladaptation on
                  the ground. Both these conceptual and practical developments
                  support the need for putting the risk of maladaptation at the
                  top of the planning agenda. The paper argues that starting
                  with the intention to avoid mistakes and not lock‐in
                  detrimental effects of adaptation‐labeled initiatives is a
                  first, key step to the wider process of adapting to climate
                  variability and change. It thus advocates for the anticipation
                  of the risk of maladaptation to become a priority for decision
                  makers and stakeholders at large, from the international to
                  the local levels. Such an ex ante approach, however, supposes
                  to get a clearer understanding of what maladaptation is.
                  Ultimately, the paper affirms that a challenge for future
                  research consists in developing context‐specific guidelines
                  that will allow funding bodies to make the best decisions to
                  support adaptation (i.e., by better capturing the risk of
                  maladaptation) and practitioners to design adaptation
                  initiatives with a low risk of maladaptation. WIREs Clim

               recorded temperature in history, and this is disrupting the usual
               balance of nature. The impacts of climate change on mammalian
               viral sharing patterns are likely to cascade in future emergence
               of zoonotic viruses. Among the thousands of expected viral
               sharing events, some of the highest risk zoonoses or potential
               zoonoses are likely to find new hosts. This may eventually pose a
               threat to human health. According to a new study, climate change
               will result in the emergence of new infectious diseases, through
               the spread of many new viruses among animal species that might be
               transmitted later on to humans. This phenomenon is expected to
               occur mainly in Africa and Asia, as both the continents have been
               historically renowned as hot spots for deadly disease spread from
               humans to animals or vice versa, including influenza, human
               immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola and severe acute respiratory
               syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) over the past decades. Virus
               modification may be affected through different aspects of climate
               changes such as sudden temperature changes and more frequent
               extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and droughts.
               This created a favorable breeding medium for viruses that aid in
               their resistance and emergence of infectious diseases. The aim of
               this chapter is to discuss the impact of climate change on viral
               diseases in Africa. The role of different climate components will
               be discussed on the viruses and the vectors/hosts, and then,

  abstract     = {Speciation-the origin of new species-is the source of the
                  diversity of life. A theory of speciation is essential to link
                  poorly understood macro-evolutionary processes, such as the
                  origin of biodiversity and adaptive radiation, to well
                  understood micro-evolutionary processes, such as allele
                  frequency change due to natural or sexual selection. An
                  important question is whether, and to what extent, the process
                  of speciation is 'adaptive', i.e., driven by natural and/or
                  sexual selection. Here, we discuss two main modelling
                  approaches in adaptive speciation theory. Ecological models of
                  speciation focus on the evolution of ecological
                  differentiation through divergent natural selection. These
                  models can explain the stable coexistence of the resulting
                  daughter species in the face of interspecific competition, but
                  they are often vague about the evolution of reproductive
                  isolation. Most sexual selection models of speciation focus on
                  the diversification of mating strategies through divergent
                  sexual selection. These models can explain the evolution of
                  prezygotic reproductive isolation, but they are typically
                  vague on questions like ecological coexistence. By means of an
                  integrated model, incorporating both ecological interactions
                  and sexual selection, we demonstrate that disruptive selection
                  on both ecological and mating strategies is necessary, but not
                  sufficient, for speciation to occur. To achieve speciation,
                  mating must at least partly reflect ecological
                  characteristics. The interaction of natural and sexual
                  selection is also pivotal in a model where sexual selection
                  facilitates ecological speciation even in the absence of
                  diverging female preferences. In view of these results, it is
                  counterproductive to consider ecological and sexual selection
                  models as contrasting and incompatible views on speciation,
                  one being dominant over the other. Instead, an integrative
                  perspective is needed to achieve a thorough and coherent
                  understanding of adaptive speciation.},

                  ecological networks in ways that have population consequences.
                  For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by
                  urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong
                  interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in
                  rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed
                  avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we
                  hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants
                  was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network
                  structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ
                  experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii)
                  was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared
                  bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control
                  forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with
                  little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities
                  of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded
                  information about nest location, and monitored nest survival.
                  For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of
                  interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation
                  resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic
                  honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of
                  interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural
                  forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival
                  increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship
                  was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest
                  overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by
                  honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network
                  shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested
                  that factors other than invasion were responsible for network
                  changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time
                  lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological
                  networks may be more challenging than anticipated.},

                  proposed in 2013 to improve harmonization of biodiversity data

                  variables which collectively capture biodiversity change at
                  multiple spatial scales and within time intervals that are of
                  scientific and management interest. Despite the apparent
                  simplicity of the concept, a plethora of variables that
                  describes not only biodiversity but also any environmental
                  features have been proposed as potential EBV (i.e. candidate
                  EBV). The proliferation of candidates reflects a lack of
                  clarity on what may constitute a variable that is essential to

                  operationalization of EBVs and therefore needs to be urgently

                  biological state variable in three key dimensions (time,
                  space, and biological organization) that is critical to
                  accurately document biodiversity change.},

                  detached from ideological, ethical, social, and, generally,
                  non-epistemic considerations. Contrary to this view, I will
                  argue that traditional measurement practices entrenched in
                  conservation are in fact permeated with non-epistemic values.
                  I challenge the received view by revealing three non-epistemic
                  assumptions underlying traditional metrics: (1) a
                  human-environment demarcation, (2) the desirability of a
                  people-free landscape, and (3) the exclusion of cultural
                  diversity from biodiversity. I also draw a connection between
                  arguments for retaining traditional metrics to “scientific
                  colonialism,” exemplified by a fortress conservation model. I
                  conclude by advocating for abandoning the myth of the

                  analysis in landscape ecology, the theoretical and empirical
                  information available in the literature generally focuses on
                  species habitat modeling and the effects of landscape
                  modification on biotic interactions have not been sufficiently
                  explored. In this study, we provide a current and
                  comprehensive overview on where we are and where we need to go
                  when considering spatial scaling and the complexity of biotic
                  interactions. Although the accumulated knowledge on scale
                  dependency of biotic interactions has increased in the last
                  decades, the use of an ecological framework involving the
                  effects of spatial scaling on species interaction networks is
                  still too limited. Generally, the few studies available in the
                  literature analyzed the landscape structure at a single level
                  or are limited to a set of a few spatial extents.
                  Additionally, the little information available in the
                  literature is related to some mechanisms involving
                  species–area relationships (i.e., combining local networks
                  into metawebs to increase the spatial sampling scales from
                  small to regional levels) and the scale of effect (i.e., the
                  spatial scale at which landscape structure best predicts a
                  network structural descriptor). We highlight the current
                  status and some potential research directions on spatial
                  scaling involving the complexity of biotic interactions, which
                  should be considered in future studies to ensure precise,
                  robust, and accurate interpretations of the organization of
                  species interaction networks and help us test specific
                  ecological hypotheses, identify potential universalities, and

                  it is crucial to find methods to better describe, manage, and
                  sustain aquatic ecosystems. Ecosystem modelling has become an
                  important tool in integrating trophic relationships into food
                  webs, assessing important nodes using network analysis, and
                  making predictions via simulations. Fortunately, several
                  modelling techniques exist, but the question is which approach
                  is relevant and applicable when? In this study, we compare
                  three modelling frameworks (Ecopath, Loop Analysis in R,
                  STELLA software) using a case study of a small aquatic network
                  (8 nodes). The choice of framework depends on the research
                  question and data availability. We approach this topic from a
                  methodological aspect by describing the data requirements and
                  by comparing the applicability and limitations of each
                  modelling approach. Each modelling framework has its specific
                  focus, but some functionalities and outcomes can be compared.
                  The predictions of Loop Analysis as compared to Ecopath’s
                  Mixed Trophic Impact plot are in good agreement at the top and
                  bottom trophic levels, but the middle trophic levels are less
                  similar. This suggests that further comparisons are needed of
                  networks of varying resolution and size. Generally, when data
                  are limiting, Loop Analysis can provide qualitative
                  predictions, while the other two methods provide quantitative
                  results, yet rely on more data.},

                  (EIDs), such as Ebola virus disease and highly pathogenic
                  influenza, are serious threats to human health and wellbeing
                  worldwide. The financial sector has an important, yet often
                  ignored, influence as owners and investors in industries that
                  are associated with anthropogenic land-use changes in
                  ecosystems linked to increased EIDs risks. We aimed to analyse
                  financial influence associated with EIDs risks that are
                  affected by anthropogenic land-use changes. We also aimed to
                  provide empirical assessments of such influence to help guide
                  engagements by governments, private organisations, and
                  non-governmental organisations with the financial sector to
                  advance a planetary health agenda. METHODS: For this
                  integrative analysis, we identified regions in the world where
                  there was evidence of a connection between EIDs and
                  anthropogenic land-use changes between Nov 9, 1999, and Oct
                  25, 2021, through a targeted literature review of academic
                  literature and grey literature to identify evidence of drivers
                  of anthropogenic land-use change and their association with
                  commodity production in these regions. We only included
                  publications in English that showed a connection between
                  deforestation and the production of one or more commodities.
                  Publications merely describing spatial or temporal land-use
                  change dynamics (eg, a reduction of forest or an increase of
                  palm-oil plantations) were excluded. As we were assessing
                  financial influence on corporate activities through ownership
                  specifically, we focused our analysis on publicly listed
                  companies. Equity data and data about ownership structure were
                  extracted from Orbis, a company information database. We
                  assessed financial influence by identifying financial entities
                  with the largest equity ownership, descriptively mapping
                  transboundary connections between investors and publicly
                  listed companies. FINDINGS: 227 public and private companies
                  operating in five economic sectors (ie, production of palm
                  oil, pulp and wood products, cocoa, soybeans, and beef)
                  between Dec 15, 2020, and March 8, 2021, were identified. Of
                  these 227, 99 (44\%) were publicly listed companies, with 2310
                  unique shareholders. These publicly listed companies operated
                  in six geographical regions, resulting in nine case-study
                  regions. 54 (55\%) companies with complete geographical
                  information were included in the countries network. Four
                  financial entities (ie, Dimensional, Vanguard, BlackRock, and
                  Norway's sovereign wealth fund) each had ownership in 39
                  companies or more in three of the case-study regions (ie,
                  north America, east Asia, and Europe). Four large US-based
                  asset managers (ie, Vanguard, BlackRock, T Rowe Price, and
                  State Street) were the largest owners of publicly listed
                  companies in terms of total equity size, with ownership
                  amounts for these four entities ranging from US$8 billion to
                  $21 billion. The specific patterns of cross-national ownership
                  depended on the region of interest; for example, financial
                  influence on EIDs risks that was associated with commodity
                  production in southeast and east Asia came from not only
                  global asset managers but also Malaysian, Chinese, Japanese,
                  and Korean financial entities. India, Brazil, the USA, Mexico,
                  and Argentina were the countries towards which investments
                  were most directed. INTERPRETATION: Although commodity supply
                  chains and financial markets are highly globalised, a small
                  number of investors and countries could be viewed as
                  disproportionally influential in sectors that increase EIDs
                  risks. Such financial influence could be used to develop and
                  implement effective policies to reduce ecological degradation
                  and mitigate EIDs risks and their effects on population
                  health. FUNDING: Formas and Networks of Financial Rupture-how
                  cascading changes in the climate and ecosystems could impact
                  on the financial sector.},

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and
                  monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses.
                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of
                  prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.},

                  authorship may present challenges. Although the International

                  potential conflicts, while a process for defining authorship

                  using social information to modulate their hormone titres.
                  Modulation of hormone titres, as proposed by the challenge
                  hypothesis, provides a mechanism by which individuals can
                  match their behaviour to their current social environment and
                  thereby avoid costs associated with prolonged high hormone
                  titres. Thus far, most work on social responsiveness of
                  hormone titres has focused on androgens in vertebrates.
                  However, there is mounting evidence that insect hormones,
                  especially juvenile hormone, may respond to social stimuli in
                  ways that parallel androgens in vertebrates. This review will
                  integrate work on social modulation of hormone titres in
                  vertebrates and insects. First we review how the
                  hormone-mediated trade-off between fecundity and life span may
                  be a key selective force favouring socially responsive hormone
                  titres in both systems. Then we review theoretical and
                  empirical work in vertebrates and insects that address how
                  factors such as social instability, dominance rank and mating
                  system influence hormone titre responsiveness. These studies
                  illustrate that (1) juvenile hormone (JH) is responsive to
                  social stimuli in a range of insect taxa and (2) JH responses
                  match key predictions of the challenge hypothesis. We conclude
                  that there are strong similarities in endocrine responsiveness
                  across vertebrate and insect taxa. The challenge hypothesis
                  provides a useful conceptual framework for hypothesis-driven
                  research in insect endocrinology. In addition, exploring areas
                  of convergence and divergence across vertebrates and insects
                  may help clarify how selection has shaped patterns of
                  endocrine responsiveness.},

                  reviewing the results of epidemiological modelling especially
                  the fractional epidemic model and summarized different types

                  However, understanding of the underlying factors driving the
                  geographic distribution of such funding remains limited. This
                  study aimed to identify the relative importance of five
                  factors (i.e., conservation targets, threat levels, costs,
                  Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and preexisting
                  investment) that potentially influence conservation funding
                  allocation at the subnational level in major deforestation
                  regions of South America between 1987 and 2013. Overall, we
                  found that funding was mainly allocated to remote areas with
                  high species richness and carbon storage, while areas with
                  high threat levels were often overlooked, especially until
                  2008. After 2008, international donors committed more funding
                  to areas with high carbon storage, but not areas with high
                  species richness, suggesting the prominence of climate-related
                  concerns over biodiversity conservation. Although often
                  advocated, we did not find evidence supporting Indigenous
                  Peoples and local communities being important in explaining
                  funding allocation. However, we identified a strong preference
                  for the Amazon as a charismatic ecoregion. Our findings
                  underscore the diverse and changing factors that drive

                  funding with local conservation needs from the perspectives of
                  different actors. We hope that our study will contribute to

                  maintains that exaptation processes can be favored by the

                  analytical and symbolic. Moreover, it distinguishes exaptation
                  processes by their nature: technology-based and use-based.
                  This work contributes to the present understanding of the
                  processes leading to novelties and innovation by identifying
                  four types of exaptation: intra-domain technology-based;
                  inter-domain technology-based; intra-domain use-based; and
                  inter-domain use-based. Following the emergent debate on the
                  creative capacity of culture, this paper offers some initial
                  elements to look at innovation through new lenses, introducing
                  the concept of exaptation as a possible way to create economic

                  adaptive potential. Here, we discuss the costs and benefits of
                  DNA copy-number alterations. Changes in DNA copy number are
                  largely detrimental. Amplifications or deletions of specific
                  genes can elicit discrete defects. Large-scale changes in DNA
                  copy number can also cause detrimental phenotypes that are due
                  to the cumulative effects of copy-number alterations of many
                  genes simultaneously. On the other hand, studies in
                  microorganisms show that DNA copy-number alterations can be
                  beneficial, increasing survival under selective pressure. As
                  DNA copy-number alterations underlie many human diseases, we
                  will end with a discussion of gene copy-number changes as

                  zoonotic origin have established large-scale epidemic
                  transmission cycles in the human population. It is often
                  considered that arbovirus emergence is driven by adaptive
                  evolution, such as virus adaptation for transmission by
                  'domestic' mosquito vector species that live in close
                  association with humans. Here, I argue that although arbovirus
                  adaptation to domestic mosquito vectors has been observed for
                  several emerging arboviruses, it was generally not directly
                  responsible for their initial emergence. Secondary adaptation
                  to domestic mosquitoes often amplified epidemic transmission,
                  however, this was more likely a consequence than a cause of
                  arbovirus emergence. Considering that emerging arboviruses are
                  generally 'preadapted' for transmission by domestic mosquito
                  vectors may help to enhance preparedness toward future

                  the extent to which the incidence of wildlife-origin
                  infectious disease outbreaks, which are likely to include
                  devastating pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, may be

                  database (REDB) to store, manage and disseminate available
                  peer-reviewed and unpublished data on raccoon (Procyon lotor)
                  biology, ecology and raccoon rabies, including citations for
                  data sources. Over 800 documents were identified and citations
                  for them entered into the database as literature references.
                  Approximately 1000 trait values were entered from almost 200
                  of these sources. These data included estimates of population
                  density, survival rates, rabies incubation period, litter
                  size, body weight, dispersal distance and home-range size,
                  often by age or sex class. Each datum is linked to a citation
                  for its source, and to information about location and land use
                  in the study area, time of year the study was undertaken,
                  sample size, and variance. The relational database design
                  enables querying and easy updating and manipulation of
                  data.The relational data model is presented, as is its
                  application in further developing an individual-based,
                  spatially-explicit population model of raccoon rabies. Using
                  information queried from the REDB benefits model development
                  by: i) assessing the appropriateness of input parameter
                  values, ii) providing sources for citing input values, iii)
                  parameterising the model to different geographic regions, iv)
                  enabling meta-analyses for evaluating model structure, as well
                  as further contributing to parameterisation at specific
                  locations, and v) providing biologically appropriate parameter
                  input values for model sensitivity testing. The REDB is a
                  useful research resource that will increase in value with
                  ongoing inclusion of data from future raccoon and raccoon
                  rabies studies and serves as a model for database design and
                  research applications to other species. The database and an

                  close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts. The
                  contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in
                  the landscape because functional connectivity can affect
                  interactions between individuals. Yet few studies have
                  explored the interplay between contact rates, conspecific
                  density, and functional connectivity. Using a spatially
                  explicit individual-based model, we investigated how empirical
                  movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact
                  rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes. We developed
                  dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing
                  movement behaviors of radio-collared raccoons, which are the
                  main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus. On this basis, we
                  simulated space-use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes
                  varying in conspecific density, forest availability, and
                  landscape connectivity. We then characterized spatial patterns
                  in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated
                  raccoons. Radio-collared raccoons were more likely to choose
                  large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along
                  least-cost paths, and had relatively long residence times in
                  anthropogenic areas, especially during daytime. These movement
                  rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual
                  landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates.
                  First, few simulated raccoons were responsible for most
                  contacts between individuals, a pattern that emerged even
                  though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules.
                  Second, per capita contact rates increased linearly with
                  individual density under most conditions, which indicates that
                  raccoon rabies transmission should be density-dependent rather
                  than frequency-dependent. Third, functional connectivity
                  created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita
                  contact rates from decreasing to increasing values, depending
                  upon the availability of land cover types. Overall, the
                  contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in
                  forests, anthropogenic areas, and agricultural corridors. We
                  show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from
                  simple empirical movement rules and, therefore, can be key
                  drivers of disease spread dynamics. The strong spatial
                  heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the
                  effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly
                  vary depending upon host density, landscape composition, and
                  functional connectivity. This study provides key functional
                  relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local
                  conditions.}

                  frameworks in operationalising and mainstreaming the idea of
                  ecosystem services. It builds on some initial discussions from
                  IPBES, which suggested that conceptual frameworks could be
                  used to: 'simplify thinking', 'structure work', 'clarify
                  issues', and 'provide a common reference point'. The analysis
                  uses the cascade model as a focus and looks at the way it has
                  been used in recent published material and across a set of
                  case studies from the EU-funded OpenNESS Project as a device
                  for conceptual framing. It found that there are examples in
                  the literature that show the cascade model indeed being used
                  as an 'organising framework', a tool for 're-framing'
                  perspectives, an 'analytical template', and as an 'application
                  framework'. Although the published materials on the cascade
                  are rich, these accounts lack insights into the process by
                  which the different versions of the model were created, and so
                  we turned to the set of OpenNESS case studies to examine how
                  they read the cascade. We found that the cascade was able to
                  provide a common reference for a diverse set of studies, and
                  that it was sufficiently flexible for it to be developed and
                  elaborated in ways that were meaningful for the different
                  place-based studies. The case studies showed that generalised
                  models like the cascade can have an important
                  'awareness-raising' role. However, we found that using models
                  of this kind it was more difficult for case studies to link
                  their work to broader societal issues such as human
                  well-being, sustainable ecosystem management, governance, and
                  competitiveness, than to their own concerns. We therefore
                  conclude that to be used effectively, conceptual models like
                  the cascade may need to be supported by other materials that
                  help users read it in different, outward looking ways. We also
                  need to find mechanisms for capturing this experience so that
                  it can be shared with others.},

                  successfully employed a bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
                  technique for improving the performance of exponential
                  smoothing. Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed
                  by Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then
                  bootstrapping is applied on the remainder series before the
                  trend and seasonality are added back, and the transformation
                  reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series.
                  Subsequently, they apply automatic exponential smoothing on
                  the original series and the bootstrapped versions of the
                  series, with the final forecast being the equal-weight
                  combination across all forecasts. In this study we attempt to
                  address the question: why does bagging for time series
                  forecasting work? We assume three sources of uncertainty
                  (model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and parameter
                  uncertainty) and we separately explore the benefits of bagging
                  for time series forecasting for each one of them. Our analysis
                  considers 4004 time series (from the M- and M3-competitions)
                  and two families of models. The results show that the benefits
                  of bagging predominantly originate from the model uncertainty:
                  the fact that different models might be selected as optimal
                  for the bootstrapped series. As such, a suitable weighted
                  combination of the most suitable models should be preferred to
                  selecting a single model.},

                  events and future climate change than rich countries. One of
                  the reasons for this is the so-called adaptation deficit, that
                  is, limits in the ability of poorer countries to adapt. This
                  paper analyses the link between income and adaptation to
                  climate events theoretically and empirically. We postulate
                  that the adaptation deficit may be due to two factors: A
                  demand effect, whereby the demand for the good “climate
                  security” increases with income, and an efficiency effect,
                  which works as a spill-over externality on the supply-side:
                  Adaptation productivity in high-income countries is enhanced
                  because of factors like better public services and stronger
                  institutions. Using panel data from the Munich Re natural
                  catastrophe database we find strong evidence for a demand
                  effect for adaptation to two climate-related extreme events,
                  tropical cyclones and floods. Evidence on the efficiency
                  effect is more equivocal. There are some indications that
                  adaptation in rich countries might be more efficient, but the
                  evidence is far from conclusive. The implication for research
                  is that better data, in particular on adaptation effort, need
                  to be collected to understand adaptation efficiency. In terms
                  of policy, we conclude that inclusive growth policies (which
                  boost adaptation demand) should be an important component of
                  international efforts to close the adaptation deficit.},

                  biodiversity reduces disease prevalence, but with inconclusive

                  transmission pathways. The relationship between vector
                  diversity and pathogen transmission remains unclear and
                  requires further study. Chagas disease is a vector-borne
                  disease most prevalent in Brazil and transmitted by multiple
                  species of insect vectors of the subfamily Triatominae, yet

                  populations remain unresolved. We tested whether triatomine
                  species richness, latitude, bioclimatic variables, human host
                  population density, and socioeconomic variables predict Chagas
                  disease mortality rates across over 5000 spatial grid cells

                  triatomine vectors is a good predictor of mortality rates
                  caused by Chagas disease, which supports the amplification
                  effect hypothesis. Vector richness and the impact of Chagas
                  disease may also be driven by latitudinal components of
                  climate and human socioeconomic factors. We provide evidence

                  biotic component of ecosystems, in terms of both biomass and
                  number of species, they are rarely considered in conservation
                  planning, except where they are thought to pose a threat to
                  the conservation of their hosts. In this review, we address a
                  number of unresolved questions concerning parasite
                  conservation. Arguments for conserving parasite species refer
                  to the intrinsic value conferred by their evolutionary
                  heritage and potential, their functional role in the provision
                  of ecosystem services, and their value as indicators of
                  ecosystem quality. We propose that proper consideration of
                  these arguments mean that it is not logically defensible to
                  automatically exclude parasite species from conservation
                  decisions; rather, endangered hosts and parasites should be
                  considered together as a threatened ecological community. The
                  extent to which parasites are threatened with extinction is
                  difficult to estimate with any degree of confidence, because
                  so many parasite species have yet to be identified and, even
                  for those which have been formally described, we have limited
                  information on the factors affecting their distribution and
                  abundance. This lack of ecological information may partially
                  explain the under-representation of parasites on threatened
                  species lists. Effective conservation of parasites requires
                  maintaining access to suitable hosts and the ecological
                  conditions that permit successful transmission between hosts.
                  When implementing recovery plans for threatened host species,
                  this may be best achieved by attempting to restore the
                  ecological conditions that maintain the host and its parasite
                  fauna in dynamic equilibrium. Ecosystem-centred conservation
                  may be a more effective strategy than species-centred (or
                  host-parasite community-centred) approaches for preventing
                  extinction of parasites, but the criteria which are typically
                  used to identify protected areas do not provide information on
                  the ecological conditions required for effective transmission.
                  We propose a simple decision tree to aid the identification of
                  appropriate conservation actions for threatened parasites.},

                  programming language in 2012 represented a significant
                  milestone in computational programming, mathematical analysis,
                  and statistical modeling. Having reached its stable release in
                  version 1.9.0 on May 7, 2023, Julia has developed into a
                  powerful and versatile instrument. Despite its potential and
                  widespread adoption across various scientific and technical
                  domains, it can be utilized within biological sciences. The
                  Aim of Review This comprehensive review aims to address this
                  particular knowledge gap and offer a thorough examination of
                  Julia's fundamental characteristics and its applications in
                  biology. Key scientific concepts of the review The review
                  focuses on a research gap in the biological science. The
                  review aims to equip researchers with knowledge and tools to
                  utilize Julia's capabilities in biological science effectively
                  and to demonstrate the gap. It paves the way for innovative
                  solutions and discoveries in this rapidly evolving field. It
                  encompasses an analysis of Julia's characteristics, packages,
                  and performance compared to the programming languages in this
                  field. The initial part of this review discusses the key
                  features of Julia, such as its dynamic and interactive nature,
                  fast processing speed, ease of expression manipulation,
                  user-friendly syntax, code readability, strong support for
                  multiple dispatch, and advanced type system. It also explores
                  Julia's capabilities in data analysis, visualization, machine
                  learning, and algorithms, making it suitable for scientific
                  applications. The next section emphasizes the importance of
                  using Julia in biological research, highlighting its seamless
                  integration with biological studies for data analysis,
                  computational biology, and bioinformatics. It also compares
                  Julia with other programming languages commonly used in
                  biological research through benchmarking and performance
                  analysis. Additionally, it provides insights into future
                  directions and potential challenges in Julia's applications in
                  biology.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus (CoV) genomes consist of positive-sense
                  single-stranded RNA and are among the largest viral RNAs known
                  to date (∼30 kb). As a result, CoVs deploy sophisticated
                  mechanisms to replicate these extraordinarily large genomes as
                  well as to transcribe subgenomic messenger RNAs. Since 2003,
                  with the emergence of three highly pathogenic CoVs (SARS-CoV,
                  MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), significant progress has been made
                  in the molecular characterization of the viral proteins and
                  key mechanisms involved in CoV RNA genome replication. For
                  example, to allow for the maintenance and integrity of their
                  large RNA genomes, CoVs have acquired RNA proofreading 3'-5'
                  exoribonuclease activity (in nonstructural protein nsp14). In
                  order to replicate the large genome, the viral-RNA-dependent
                  RNA polymerase (RdRp; in nsp12) is supplemented by a
                  processivity factor (made of the viral complex nsp7/nsp8),
                  making it the fastest known RdRp. Lastly, a viral structural
                  protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is primarily
                  involved in genome encapsidation, is required for efficient
                  viral replication and transcription. Therefore, CoVs are a
                  paradox among positive-strand RNA viruses in the sense that
                  they use both a processivity factor and have proofreading
                  activity reminiscent of DNA organisms in addition to
                  structural proteins that mediate efficient RNA synthesis,
                  commonly used by negative-strand RNA viruses. In this review,
                  we present a historical perspective of these unsuspected
                  discoveries and detail the current knowledge on the core
                  replicative machinery deployed by CoVs.},

  abstract     = {It is widely recognized that indirect effects due to adaptive
                  behaviors can have important effects on food webs. One
                  consequence may be to change how readily perturbations
                  propagate through the web, because species' behaviors as well
                  as densities may respond to perturbations. It is not well
                  understood which types of behavior are more likely to
                  facilitate versus inhibit propagation of disturbances through
                  a food web, or how this might be affected by the shape of a
                  food web or the patterns of interaction strengths within it.
                  We model two simple, laterally expanded food webs (one with
                  three trophic levels and one with four), and compare how
                  various adaptive behaviors affect the potential for a newly
                  introduced predator to change the equilibrium densities of
                  distant species. Patterns of changes in response to the
                  introduction were qualitatively similar across most models, as
                  were the ways in which patterns of direct interaction
                  strengths affected those responses. Depending on both the web
                  structure and the specific adaptive behavior, the potential
                  for density changes to propagate through the web could be
                  either increased or diminished relative to the no-behavior
                  model. Two behaviors allowed density changes to propagate
                  through a four-level web that precluded such propagation in
                  the no-behavior model, and each of these two behaviors led to
                  qualitatively different patterns of density changes. In the
                  one model (diet choice) in which density changes were able to
                  propagate in both web structures, patterns of density changes
                  differed qualitatively between webs. Some of our results
                  flowed from the fact that behaviors did not interact directly
                  in the systems we considered, so that indirect effects on
                  distant species had to be at least partly density-mediated.
                  Our models highlight this as an inherent limitation of
                  considering in isolation behaviors that are strictly
                  foraging-related or strictly defense-related, making a case
                  for the value of simultaneously considering multiple
                  interacting types of behavior in the same model.},

                  imaging studies we employed a cognitive load paradigm to
                  isolate the neural correlates of deductive reasoning and
                  address the role (if any) of language in deduction. Healthy
                  participants evaluated the logical status of arguments varying
                  in deductive complexity but matched in linguistic complexity.
                  Arguments also varied in lexical content, involving blocks and
                  pseudo-words in Experiment I and faces and houses in
                  Experiment II. For each experiment, subtraction of simple from
                  complex arguments (collapsing across contents) revealed a
                  network of activations disjoint from regions traditionally
                  associated with linguistic processing and also disjoint from

                  cortices, which maintain the formal structure of arguments.
                  Core regions, in the left rostral (BA 10p) and bilateral
                  medial (BA 8) prefrontal cortex, perform deductive operations.
                  Finally, restricting the complex-simple subtraction to each
                  lexical content uncovered additional activations which may
                  reflect the binding of logical variables to lexical items.},

                  to determine the current status of One Health frameworks and
                  case studies reporting One Health metrics. Of 1839 unique

                  exchange are still significant challenges for practical
                  adoption of the One Health paradigm. To address these needs
                  the "One Health Surveillance Codex" (OHS Codex) was
                  established to provide a framework for the One Health
                  community to continuously share practical solutions (e.g.
                  tools, technical resources, guidance documents and
                  experiences) applicable for national and international
                  stakeholders from different One Health Surveillance sectors.
                  Currently, the OHS Codex provides a number of resources that
                  support the adoption of the OH paradigm in areas linked to the
                  harmonization and interpretation of surveillance data. The OHS
                  Codex framework comprises four high-level "action" principles,
                  which respectively support collaboration, knowledge exchange,
                  data interoperability, and dissemination. These principles
                  match well with priority areas identified in the "Tripartite
                  Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries" published
                  by WHO, FAO and OIE. Within each of the four principles, the
                  OHS Codex provides a collection of useful resources as well as
                  pointers to success stories for the application of these
                  resources. As the OHS Codex is designed as an open community
                  framework, it will continuously evolve and adapt to the needs
                  of the OH community in the future.},

                  neanderthalensis) and the question of whether or not they
                  dispersed into Southern Scandinavia, two contradictory
                  hypotheses can be identified. The first, and also the most
                  widely endorsed, hereafter, hypothesis A, argues primarily
                  that Neanderthals did not occupy regions above 55°N because of
                  1) climatic constraints and 2) dispersal barriers. The second,
                  hypothesis B, argues that they possibly occasionally dispersed
                  above 55°N, but that factors such as 1) research- and/or 2)
                  taphonomic bias are responsible for their archaeological
                  invisibility. Here, we report an evaluation of these competing
                  hypotheses. To this end, we reconstruct the environment for
                  the time period and region of interest (the Last Interglacial
                  Complex and Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia), based
                  on three lines of evidence: palaeoenvironmental reconstruction
                  combined with a novel habitat modelling approach, a review of
                  relevant archaeological localities, and a discussion of the
                  possible impacts of both research biases and the taphonomic
                  effects on the archaeological data. We focus particularly on
                  the climatic and geological explanatory factors relevant to
                  the two hypotheses. Our results are inconsistent with the
                  claim that climatic constraint and/or a lack of suitable
                  habitats can fully explain the absence of Neanderthals in
                  Southern Scandinavia during the Eemian Interglacial and Early
                  Weichselian Glaciation. We do, however, find evidence that a
                  geographic barrier may have impeded northerly migrations
                  during the Eemian. The evidence reviewed here suggests that
                  both research bias and taphonomy – consistent with hypothesis
                  B – could account for the archaeological invisibility of
                  Neanderthals in Southern Scandinavia, highlighting the need
                  for further strategic survey and/or excavation efforts in the

                  presents numerous challenges. These include spectral mixing of
                  diverse land cover components within pixels, spectral
                  confusion with other land cover features such as fallow
                  agricultural fields and the fact that urban classes of
                  interest are of the land use and not the land cover category.
                  A new methodology to address these issues is proposed. This
                  approach involves, as a first step, the generation of two
                  independent but rudimentary land cover products, one
                  spectral-based at the pixel level and the other segment-based.
                  These classifications are then merged through a rule-based
                  approach to generate a final product with enhanced land use
                  classes and accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of derived
                  products of Ottawa, Calgary and cities in southwestern Ontario
                  is presented based on conventional ground reference data as
                  well as inter-classification consistency analyses. Producer
                  accuracies of 78\% and 73\% have been achieved for urban
                  ‘residential’ and ‘commercial/industrial’ classes,
                  respectively. The capability of Landsat TM to detect low
                  density residential areas is assessed based on dwelling and
                  population data derived from aerial photography and the 2001
                  Canadian census. For low population densities (i.e. below 3000
                  persons/km2), density is observed to be monotonically related
                  to the fraction of pixels labeled ‘residential’. At higher
                  densities, the fraction of pixels labeled ‘residential’
                  remains constant due to Landsat's inability to distinguish
                  between high-rise apartment dwellings and
                  commercial/industrial structures.},

                  scaling of mutation rate with genome size and for the likely
                  mechanisms that drive this pattern. Support is presented for
                  the hypothesis that natural selection pushes mutation rates
                  down to a lower limit set by the power of random genetic drift
                  rather than by intrinsic physiological limitations, and that
                  this has resulted in reduced levels of replication,
                  transcription, and translation fidelity in eukaryotes relative
                  to prokaryotes.},

                  introduced parasites alter food webs qualitatively through
                  topological changes and quantitatively through shifts in
                  trophic relationships arising from modified host phenotypic
                  traits. I argue that predicting the extent of food web
                  reorganisation is, however, difficult due to underlying
                  ecological and evolutionary processes that could provide
                  contrasting food web outcomes, including enemy release, biotic
                  resistance, and parasite spillover and spillback.
                  Nevertheless, I suggest these food web reorganisations

                  discrete sexes are inextricably linked with gamete type.
                  However, this binarized operationalization does not adequately
                  reflect the diversity of sex observed in nature. This is due,
                  in part, to the fact that sex exists across many levels of
                  biological analysis, including genetic, molecular, cellular,
                  morphological, behavioral, and population levels. Furthermore,
                  the biological mechanisms governing sex are embedded in
                  complex networks that dynamically interact with other systems.

                  researchers faced with the task of constructing such maps are
                  aware of problems with the modelling data and of decisions
                  that they make within the modelling process that are likely to
                  affect the output, but they find it difficult to quantify this
                  information. In some cases they attempt to evaluate the
                  modelled predictions against independent data, but the summary
                  statistics have no spatial component and do not address errors
                  in the predictions. It is proposed that maps of uncertainty
                  would help in the interpretation of these summaries, and to
                  emphasize patterns in uncertainty such as spatial clustering
                  or links with particular covariates. This paper reviews the
                  aspects of uncertainty that are relevant to habitat maps
                  developed with logistic regression, and suggests methods for
                  investigating and communicating these uncertainties. It
                  addresses the problems of subjective judgement, model
                  uncertainty and vague concepts along with the more commonly
                  considered uncertainties of random and systematic error.
                  Methods for developing realistic confidence intervals are
                  presented along with suggestions on how to visualize the

                  (ML) systems supporting high-stakes policy decisions in areas
                  such as health, criminal justice, education, and employment.
                  While the field of explainable ML has expanded in recent
                  years, much of this work has not taken real-world needs into
                  account. A majority of proposed methods are designed with
                  generic explainability goals without well-defined use cases or
                  intended end users and evaluated on simplified tasks,
                  benchmark problems/datasets, or with proxy users (e.g., Amazon
                  Mechanical Turk). We argue that these simplified evaluation
                  settings do not capture the nuances and complexities of
                  real-world applications. As a result, the applicability and
                  effectiveness of this large body of theoretical and
                  methodological work in real-world applications are unclear. In
                  this work, we take steps toward addressing this gap for the
                  domain of public policy. First, we identify the primary use
                  cases of explainable ML within public policy problems. For
                  each use case, we define the end users of explanations and the
                  specific goals the explanations have to fulfill. Finally, we
                  map existing work in explainable ML to these use cases,
                  identify gaps in established capabilities, and propose
                  research directions to fill those gaps to have a practical
                  societal impact through ML. The contribution is (a) a
                  methodology for explainable ML researchers to identify use
                  cases and develop methods targeted at them and (b) using that
                  methodology for the domain of public policy and giving an
                  example for the researchers on developing explainable ML
                  methods that result in real-world impact.},

                  deep-rooted obstacles that stem from the need for more
                  equitable access to data and best practices to guide analyses
                  of the fossil record. Recent progress has been accelerated by
                  a collective push toward more collaborative,
                  interdisciplinary, and open science, especially by
                  early-career researchers. Here, we survey four challenges
                  facing analytical paleobiology from an early-career
                  perspective: (1) accounting for biases when interpreting the
                  fossil record; (2) integrating fossil and modern biodiversity
                  data; (3) building data science skills; and (4) increasing
                  data accessibility and equity. We discuss recent efforts to
                  address each challenge, highlight persisting barriers, and
                  identify tools that have advanced analytical work. Given the
                  inherent linkages between these challenges, we encourage
                  discourse across disciplines to find common solutions. We also
                  affirm the need for systemic changes that reevaluate how we
                  conduct and share paleobiological research.},

                  tool in community ecology. Because organisms with the same
                  lifestyle can still exhibit ecological differences, it is
                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be
                  described. Here we show that networks of hosts (mammals) and
                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to
                  include in ecological networks, which we discuss in the light
                  of community ecology and epidemiology.},

                  criteria: historical genesis (features built by natural
                  selection for their present role) and current utility
                  (features now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose).
                  Biologists have often failed to recognize the potential
                  confusion between these different definitions because we have
                  tended to view natural selection as so dominant among
                  evolutionary mechanisms that historical process and current
                  product become one. Yet if many features of organisms are
                  non-adapted, but available for useful cooptation in
                  descendants, then an important concept has no name in our
                  lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain unconsidered):
                  features that now enhance fitness but were not built by
                  natural selection for their current role. We propose that such
                  features be called exaptations and that adaptation be
                  restricted, as Darwin suggested, to features built by
                  selection for their current role. We present several examples
                  of exaptation, indicating where a failure to conceptualize
                  such an idea limited the range of hypotheses previously
                  available. We explore several consequences of exaptation and
                  propose a terminological solution to the problem of
                  preadaptation.},

                  bagging, each predictor (single hypothesis) is learned from a
                  bootstrap sample of the training examples; the output of a bag
                  (a set of predictors) on an example is determined by voting.
                  The out-of-bag estimate is based on recording the votes of
                  each predictor on those training examples omitted from its
                  bootstrap sample. Because no additional predictors are
                  generated, the out-of-bag estimate requires considerably less
                  time than 10-fold cross-validation. We address the question of
                  how to use the out-of-bag estimate to estimate generalization
                  error on two-class datasets. Our experiments on several
                  datasets show that the out-of-bag estimate and 10-fold
                  cross-validation have similar performance, but are both
                  biased. We can eliminate most of the bias in the out-of-bag
                  estimate and increase accuracy by incorporating a correction
                  based on the distribution of the out-of-bag votes.},

                  important activity for ecologists but when compared with
                  analysis the method of synthesis has received little
                  attention. Ecologists usually proceed intuitively and this can
                  lead to a problem in defining differences between the
                  syntheses made by different scientists. It also leads to
                  criticism from scientists favoring analytical approaches that
                  the construction of general theory is an activity that does
                  not follow the scientific method. We outline a methodology for
                  scientific inference about integrative concepts and the
                  syntheses made in constructing them and illustrate how this
                  can be applied in the development of general theory from
                  investigations into particular ecological systems. The
                  objective is to construct a causal scientific explanation.
                  This has four characteristics. (1) It defines causal and/or
                  organizational processes that describe how systems function.
                  (2) These processes are consistent – under the same conditions
                  they will produce the same effect. (3) A causal scientific
                  explanation provides general information about events of a
                  similar kind. (4) When experiments are possible then a
                  designed manipulation will produce a predictable response. The
                  essential characteristic of making synthesis to construct a
                  causal scientific explanation is that it is progressive and we
                  judge progress made by assessing the coherence of the
                  explanation using six criteria: acceptability of individual
                  propositions including that they have been tested with data,
                  consistency of concept definitions, consistency in the type of
                  concepts used in making the explanation, that ad hoc
                  propositions are not used, that there is economy in the number
                  of propositions used, that the explanation applies to broad
                  questions. We illustrate development of a causal scientific
                  explanation for the concept of long-lived pioneer tree
                  species, show how the coherence of this explanation can be
                  assessed, and how it could be improved.},

                  Recent work on food webs suggests that habitat homogenization
                  and the loss of mobile predators from the top of the food
                  chain is seriously reducing the robustness of whole ecosystems
                  in the face of change. Time, therefore, to replace species

                  biomass in these ecosystems. We found that parasite biomass
                  exceeded that of top predators. The biomass of trematodes was
                  particularly high, being comparable to that of the abundant
                  birds, fishes, burrowing shrimps and polychaetes. Trophically
                  transmitted parasites and parasitic castrators subsumed more
                  biomass than did other parasitic functional groups. The
                  extended phenotype biomass controlled by parasitic castrators
                  sometimes exceeded that of their uninfected hosts. The annual
                  production of free-swimming trematode transmission stages was
                  greater than the combined biomass of all quantified parasites
                  and was also greater than bird biomass. This biomass and

                  evaluating uncertainty about the effects of human actions on
                  climate. The traditional method of establishing these
                  scenarios was a time-consuming sequential process, each
                  discipline taking turns to add data and complexity. As Richard
                  Moss and colleagues explain in a Perspectives review, climate
                  change researchers have now established a new coordinated
                  parallel process that integrates the tasks of developing
                  scenarios, making projections and evaluating their impact.
                  These 'next generation' scenarios should make for faster, more
                  rigorous assessment of proposals for climate mitigation and
                  adaptation. Advances in the science and observation of climate
                  change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent
                  variability of Earth’s climate system and its likely response
                  to human and natural influences. The implications of climate
                  change for the environment and society will depend not only on
                  the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative
                  forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes
                  in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive
                  uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to
                  climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the
                  future to explore the potential consequences of different
                  response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately
                  examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change
                  mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research
                  processes that slowed the exchange of information among
                  physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a
                  new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate
                  some of the most challenging and important questions about

                  competition relative to facilitation. However, it is not known
                  whether this benefit is received by each participant node in
                  proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence.
                  This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced
                  by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by
                  applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an
                  ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here
                  we report two main results. First, nodes contribute
                  heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the
                  network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a
                  strong contributor tends to decrease overall network
                  persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor.
                  Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not
                  gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes
                  most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of
                  these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a
                  15-year time series of the interactions between designer and
                  contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As
                  with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability
                  decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases.
                  Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study
                  of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially
                  address questions about the impact of invasive species in
                  ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

                  from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public
                  health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic
                  spillover requires several factors to align, including the
                  ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of
                  pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect
                  susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we
                  propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission
                  that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework
                  reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a
                  hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections
                  in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally
                  and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and
                  time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or
                  prevent spillover events. This work provides a foundation for

                  Environmental shifts that cause species loss or fluctuations
                  in community composition are expected to become more common,
                  so it is important to understand the evolutionary forces that
                  shape the stability and function of the emergent community.
                  Here we study experimental cultures of a simple, ecologically
                  stable community of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus
                  plantarum, in order to understand how the presence or absence
                  of a species impacts coexistence over evolutionary timescales.
                  We found that evolution in coculture led to drastically
                  altered evolutionary outcomes for L. plantarum, but not S.
                  cerevisiae. Both monoculture- and co-culture-evolved L.
                  plantarum evolved dozens of mutations over 925 generations of
                  evolution, but only L. plantarum that had evolved in isolation
                  from S. cerevisiae lost the capacity to coexist with S.
                  cerevisiae. We find that the evolutionary loss of ecological
                  stability corresponds with fitness differences between
                  monoculture-evolved L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae and genetic
                  changes that repeatedly evolve across the replicate
                  populations of L. plantarum. This work shows how coevolution
                  within a community can prevent destabilising evolution in
                  individual species, thereby preserving ecological diversity

                  analysis may help us understand the health of populations.
                  Epidemiologists first analyzed wastewater to track outbreaks
                  of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based
                  epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels
                  while bypassing the difficulties and pit falls of individual
                  testing. Current approaches overlook the activity of most
                  human viruses and preclude a deeper understanding of human
                  virome community dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive
                  sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater
                  samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical
                  to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting
                  thousands of viral species or variants. Over 450 distinct
                  pathogenic viruses from 28 viral families are observed, most
                  of which have never been detected in such samples. Sequencing
                  reads of established pathogens and emerging viruses correlate
                  to clinical data sets of SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and
                  monkeypox viruses, outlining the public health utility of this
                  approach. Viral communities are tightly organized by space and
                  time. Finally, the most abundant human viruses yield sequence
                  variant information consistent with regional spread and
                  evolution. We reveal the viral landscape of human wastewater
                  and its potential to improve our understanding of outbreaks,
                  transmission, and its effects on overall population health.},

                  shaped locally by interactions between climatic and
                  socio-environmental factors is not well understood. Here, we
                  investigate the drivers of dengue incidence and emergence in
                  Vietnam, through analysing 23 years of district-level case
                  data spanning a period of significant socioeconomic change
                  (1998-2020). We show that urban infrastructure factors
                  (sanitation, water supply, long-term urban growth) predict
                  local spatial patterns of dengue incidence, while human
                  mobility is a more influential driver in subtropical northern
                  regions than the endemic south. Temperature is the dominant
                  factor shaping dengue's distribution and dynamics, and using
                  long-term reanalysis temperature data we show that warming
                  since 1950 has expanded transmission risk throughout Vietnam,
                  and most strongly in current dengue emergence hotspots (e.g.,
                  southern central regions, Ha Noi). In contrast, effects of
                  hydrometeorology are complex, multi-scalar and dependent on
                  local context: risk increases under either short-term
                  precipitation excess or long-term drought, but improvements in
                  water supply mitigate drought-associated risks except under
                  extreme conditions. Our findings challenge the assumption that
                  dengue is an urban disease, instead suggesting that incidence
                  peaks in transitional landscapes with intermediate
                  infrastructure provision, and provide evidence that
                  interactions between recent climate change and mobility are

                  pathogen in Europe where it represents a new public health

                  driver of its spatial expansion on the continent, a formal
                  evaluation of this causal relationship is lacking. Here, we
                  investigate the extent to which WNV spatial expansion in

                  for other direct human influences such as land-use and human
                  population changes. To this end, we trained ecological niche
                  models to predict the risk of local WNV circulation leading to
                  human cases to then unravel the isolated effect of climate

                  based on the same environmental changes but a counterfactual

                  whereas this area remains largely unchanged in a

                  due to historical changes in population density, but that

                  reduce the risk of future pandemics. Reducing this risk
                  requires investment in prevention, preparedness, and response.
                  Although preparedness and response have received significant
                  focus, prevention, especially the prevention of zoonotic
                  spillover, remains largely absent from global conversations.
                  This oversight is due in part to the lack of a clear

                  wildfires, this approach ensures that remaining wildfires burn
                  under more extreme conditions. Here, we term this the
                  “suppression bias” and use a simulation model to highlight how
                  this bias fundamentally impacts wildfire activity, independent
                  of fuel accumulation and climate change. We illustrate how
                  attempting to suppress all wildfires necessarily means that
                  fires will burn with more severe and less diverse ecological
                  impacts, with burned area increasing at faster rates than
                  expected from fuel accumulation or climate change. Over a
                  human lifespan, the modeled impacts of the suppression bias
                  exceed those from fuel accumulation or climate change alone,
                  suggesting that suppression may exert a significant and
                  underappreciated influence on patterns of fire globally.
                  Managing wildfires to safely burn under low and moderate

                  due to climate change. Here, we use empirical data from 732

                  assessments face challenges to appraise the growing
                  literature. Here we use the language model BERT to identify
                  and classify studies on observed climate impacts, producing a
                  comprehensive machine-learning-assisted evidence map. We
                  estimate that 102,160 (64,958–164,274) publications document a
                  broad range of observed impacts. By combining our spatially
                  resolved database with grid-cell-level human-attributable
                  changes in temperature and precipitation, we infer that
                  attributable anthropogenic impacts may be occurring across
                  80\% of the world’s land area, where 85\% of the population
                  reside. Our results reveal a substantial ‘attribution gap’ as
                  robust levels of evidence for potentially attributable impacts
                  are twice as prevalent in high-income than in low-income

                  growing on the impacts of climate change on human and natural

                  host-parasite webs, are reorganizing as species abundances and
                  spatial distributions shift in response to environmental
                  change. Current theoretical expectations for how this
                  reorganization will occur are available for competition or for
                  parts of interaction networks, but these may not extend to
                  more complex networks. Here we use metacommunity theory to
                  develop new expectations for how complex networks will
                  reorganize under environmental change, and show that dispersal
                  is crucial for determining the degree to which networks will
                  retain their composition and structure. When dispersal between
                  habitat patches is low, all types of species interactions act
                  as a strong determinant for whether species can colonize
                  suitable habitats. This colonization resistance drives species
                  turnover, which breaks apart current networks and leads to the
                  formation of new networks. However, when dispersal rates are
                  increased, colonists arrive in high abundance in habitats
                  where they are well adapted, so interactions with resident
                  species contribute less to colonization success. Dispersal
                  ensures that species associations are maintained as they shift
                  in space, so networks retain similar composition and
                  structure. The crucial role of dispersal reinforces the need
                  to manage habitat connectivity to sustain species and
                  interaction diversity into the future.},

                  variables' (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species
                  populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and
                  sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of
                  models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions
                  that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We
                  define the species population EBVs as a
                  space-time-species-gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses
                  the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its

                  Our quantitative review of the recent literature reveals a
                  general lack of sufficient information to fully reproduce the

                  report the version or access date of the underlying data, and
                  only half reported model parameters. To address this problem,
                  we propose adopting a checklist to guide studies in reporting

                  niche modelling reproducibility, offering a straightforward

                  impacts can combine additively or can interact, causing
                  synergistic or antagonistic effects. Our knowledge of when and
                  how interactions arise is limited, as most models and
                  experiments only consider the effect of a small number of
                  non-interacting stressors at one or few scales of ecological
                  organization. This is concerning because it could lead to
                  significant underestimations or overestimations of threats to
                  biodiversity. Furthermore, stressors have been largely

                  that the predictability of multiple stressor effects, and

                  examining the distribution of stressor effects across targets

                  difficulty in warming natural environments. Here we bridge

                  natural stream temperature gradient to test whether warming
                  and apex fish predators have interactive effects on freshwater

                  and microbial decomposition via both green and brown pathways
                  in the food web, but only under warming. Neither temperature
                  nor the presence of fish altered food web structure alone, but
                  connectance and mean trophic level declined as consumer
                  species were lost when both drivers acted together. A

                  crocodylians, number fewer than 30 species, more than 700
                  pseudosuchian species are known from their 250-million-year
                  fossil record, displaying far greater ecomorphological
                  diversity than their extant counterparts. With a new
                  time-calibrated tree of >500 species, we use a phylogenetic
                  framework to reveal that pseudosuchian evolutionary history
                  and diversification dynamics were directly shaped by the
                  interplay of abiotic and biotic processes over hundreds of
                  millions of years, supported by information theory analyses.
                  Speciation, but not extinction, is correlated with higher
                  temperatures in terrestrial and marine lineages, with high sea
                  level associated with heightened extinction in non-marine
                  taxa. Low lineage diversity and increased speciation in
                  non-marine species is consistent with opportunities for
                  niche-filling, whereas increased competition may have led to
                  elevated extinction rates. In marine lineages, competition via
                  increased lineage diversity appears to have driven both
                  speciation and extinction. Decoupling speciation and
                  extinction, in combination with ecological partitioning,
                  reveals a more complex picture of pseudosuchian evolution than
                  previously understood. As the number of species threatened
                  with extinction by anthropogenic climate change continues to
                  rise, the fossil record provides a unique window into the
                  drivers that led to clade success and those that may
                  ultimately lead to extinction.},

                  approximately 20\% of co-occurrences correspond to actual
                  interactions. Moreover, the degree distribution shifts from
                  exponential in co-occurrence networks to power laws in
                  networks of biotic interactions. This shift results from a
                  strong interplay between species’ biotic (their interacting
                  partners) and abiotic (their environmental requirements)

                  different viral families, with either structural or auxiliary

                  is far greater than in low- and middle-income countries

                  understanding of the impacts of introduced species on
                  ecological networks and their biogeographic patterns globally.
                  Here we address this data gap by analysing mutualistic
                  seed-dispersal interactions from 410 local networks,
                  encompassing 24,455 unique pairwise interactions between 1,631
                  animal and 3,208 plant species. We show that species
                  introductions reduce biogeographic compartmentalization of the
                  global meta-network, in which nodes are species and links are
                  interactions observed within any local network. This
                  homogenizing effect extends across spatial scales, decreasing
                  beta diversity among local networks and modularity within
                  networks. The prevalence of introduced interactions is
                  directly related to human environmental modifications and is
                  accelerating, having increased sevenfold over the past 75
                  years. These dynamics alter the coevolutionary environments
                  that mutualists experience6, and we find that introduced
                  species disproportionately interact with other introduced
                  species. These processes are likely to amplify biotic
                  homogenization in future ecosystems7 and may reduce the
                  resilience of ecosystems by allowing perturbations to
                  propagate more quickly and exposing disparate ecosystems to
                  similar drivers. Our results highlight the importance of
                  managing the increasing homogenization of ecological
                  complexity.},

  abstract     = {During recent decades, pathogens that originated in bats have
                  become an increasing public health concern. A major challenge
                  is to identify how those pathogens spill over into human
                  populations to generate a pandemic threat1. Many correlational
                  studies associate spillover with changes in land use or other
                  anthropogenic stressors2,3, although the mechanisms underlying
                  the observed correlations have not been identified4. One
                  limitation is the lack of spatially and temporally explicit
                  data on multiple spillovers, and on the connections among
                  spillovers, reservoir host ecology and behaviour and viral
                  dynamics. We present 25 years of data on land-use change, bat
                  behaviour and spillover of Hendra virus from Pteropodid bats
                  to horses in subtropical Australia. These data show that bats
                  are responding to environmental change by persistently
                  adopting behaviours that were previously transient responses
                  to nutritional stress. Interactions between land-use change
                  and climate now lead to persistent bat residency in
                  agricultural areas, where periodic food shortages drive
                  clusters of spillovers. Pulses of winter flowering of trees in
                  remnant forests appeared to prevent spillover. We developed
                  integrative Bayesian network models based on these phenomena
                  that accurately predicted the presence or absence of clusters
                  of spillovers in each of the 25 years. Our long-term study
                  identifies the mechanistic connections between habitat loss,
                  climate and increased spillover risk. It provides a framework
                  for examining causes of bat virus spillover and for developing
                  ecological countermeasures to prevent pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Modern humans have populated Europe for more than 45,000
                  years1,2. Our knowledge of the genetic relatedness and
                  structure of ancient hunter-gatherers is however limited,
                  owing to the scarceness and poor molecular preservation of
                  human remains from that period3. Here we analyse 356 ancient
                  hunter-gatherer genomes, including new genomic data for 116
                  individuals from 14 countries in western and central Eurasia,
                  spanning between 35,000 and 5,000 years ago. We identify a
                  genetic ancestry profile in individuals associated with Upper
                  Palaeolithic Gravettian assemblages from western Europe that
                  is distinct from contemporaneous groups related to this
                  archaeological culture in central and southern Europe4, but
                  resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the
                  Aurignacian culture. This ancestry profile survived during the
                  Last Glacial Maximum (25,000 to 19,000 years ago) in human
                  populations from southwestern Europe associated with the
                  Solutrean culture, and with the following Magdalenian culture
                  that re-expanded northeastward after the Last Glacial Maximum.
                  Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe
                  suggesting a local replacement of human groups around the time
                  of the Last Glacial Maximum, accompanied by a north-to-south
                  dispersal of populations associated with the Epigravettian
                  culture. From at least 14,000 years ago, an ancestry related
                  to this culture spread from the south across the rest of
                  Europe, largely replacing the Magdalenian-associated gene
                  pool. After a period of limited admixture that spanned the
                  beginning of the Mesolithic, we find genetic interactions
                  between western and eastern European hunter-gatherers, who
                  were also characterized by marked differences in
                  phenotypically relevant variants.},

                  consequently, they are often treated independently4,5. Here,

                  However, predator loss is accelerating globally4–6, and
                  predator mass-mortality events7 (MMEs)—rapid large-scale
                  die-offs—are now emblematic of the Anthropocene epoch6. Owing
                  to their rare and unpredictable nature7, we lack an
                  understanding of how MMEs immediately impact ecosystems. Past
                  predator-removal studies2,3 may be insufficient to understand
                  the ecological consequences of MMEs because, in nature, dead
                  predators decompose in situ and generate a resource pulse8,
                  which could alter ensuing ecosystem dynamics by temporarily
                  enhancing productivity. Here we experimentally induce MMEs in
                  tritrophic, freshwater lake food webs and report ecological
                  dynamics that are distinct from predator losses2,3 or resource
                  pulses9 alone, but that can be predicted from theory8. MMEs
                  led to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer
                  communities resulting from weakened top-down predator
                  control1–3 and stronger bottom-up effects through predator
                  decomposition8. In contrast to predator removals alone,
                  enhanced primary production after MMEs dampened the consumer
                  community response. As a consequence, MMEs generated biomass
                  dynamics that were most similar to those of undisturbed
                  systems, indicating that they may be cryptic disturbances in
                  nature. These biomass dynamics led to trophic decoupling,
                  whereby the indirect beneficial effects of predators on
                  primary producers are lost and later materialize as direct
                  bottom-up effects that stimulate primary production amid
                  intensified herbivory. These results reveal ecological
                  signatures of MMEs and demonstrate the feasibility of
                  forecasting novel ecological dynamics arising with
                  intensifying global change. Predator mass-mortality events
                  lead to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer
                  communities resulting from weakened top-down predator control

  abstract     = {The possibility that the Amazon forest system could soon reach
                  a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised
                  global concern1–3. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests
                  remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now,
                  the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress
                  from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and
                  fires, even in central and remote parts of the system1. Long
                  existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental
                  conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify
                  ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical
                  transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major
                  drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as
                  potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if
                  crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide
                  forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various
                  disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10\% to 47\% of
                  Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances
                  that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and
                  potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples
                  of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three
                  most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different
                  feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the
                  inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about
                  future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action.
                  Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will
                  depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation
                  and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts
                  to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Analyses of drivers of water
                  stress are used to predict likely trajectories of the Amazon
                  forest system and suggests potential actions that could

  abstract     = {Social scientists have increasingly turned to the experimental
                  method to understand human behaviour. One critical issue that
                  makes solving social problems difficult is scaling up the idea
                  from a small group to a larger group in more diverse
                  situations. The urgency of scaling policies impacts us every
                  day, whether it is protecting the health and safety of a
                  community or enhancing the opportunities of future
                  generations. Yet, a common result is that, when we scale up
                  ideas, most experience a ‘voltage drop’—that is, on scaling,
                  the cost–benefit profile depreciates considerably. Here I
                  argue that, to reduce voltage drops, we must optimally
                  generate policy-based evidence. Optimality requires answering
                  two crucial questions: what information should be generated
                  and in what sequence. The economics underlying the science of
                  scaling provides insights into these questions, which are in
                  some cases at odds with conventional approaches. For example,
                  there are important situations in which I advocate flipping
                  the traditional social science research model to an approach
                  that, from the beginning, produces the type of policy-based
                  evidence that the science of scaling demands. To do so, I
                  propose augmenting efficacy trials by including relevant tests
                  of scale in the original discovery process, which forces the
                  scientist to naturally start with a recognition of the big
                  picture: what information do I need to have scaling
                  confidence? To reduce voltage drops—the depreciation of the
                  cost–benefit profile when scaling up solutions to social
                  problems—sufficient policy-based evidence must be generated
                  before policymakers scale up the project.},

                  that their appeal comes from promises to improve productivity
                  and objectivity by overcoming human shortcomings. But proposed
                  AI solutions can also exploit our cognitive limitations,
                  making us vulnerable to illusions of understanding in which we
                  believe we understand more about the world than we actually
                  do. Such illusions obscure the scientific community’s ability
                  to see the formation of scientific monocultures, in which some
                  types of methods, questions and viewpoints come to dominate
                  alternative approaches, making science less innovative and

                  change1. Signals of biodiversity change come from time-series
                  abundance datasets for thousands of species over large
                  geographic and temporal scales. Analyses of these biodiversity
                  datasets have pointed to varied trends in abundance, including
                  increases and decreases. However, these analyses have not
                  fully accounted for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic
                  structures in the data. Here, using a new statistical
                  framework, we show across ten high-profile biodiversity
                  datasets2–11 that increases and decreases under existing
                  approaches vanish once spatial, temporal and phylogenetic
                  structures are accounted for. This is a consequence of
                  existing approaches severely underestimating trend uncertainty
                  and sometimes misestimating the trend direction. Under our
                  revised average abundance trends that appropriately recognize
                  uncertainty, we failed to observe a single increasing or
                  decreasing trend at 95\% credible intervals in our ten
                  datasets. This emphasizes how little is known about
                  biodiversity change across vast spatial and taxonomic scales.
                  Despite this uncertainty at vast scales, we reveal improved
                  local-scale prediction accuracy by accounting for spatial,
                  temporal and phylogenetic structures. Improved prediction
                  offers hope of estimating biodiversity change at
                  policy-relevant scales, guiding adaptive conservation
                  responses. This study presents an approach to deal with
                  spatial, temporal and phylogenetic non-independence in
                  large-scale analyses of biodiversity change, improving trend

                  infectious diseases, which are significantly correlated with
                  socioeconomic, environmental and ecological factors1. Studies
                  have shown that infectious disease risk is modified by changes
                  to biodiversity2-6, climate change7-11, chemical
                  pollution12-14, landscape transformations15-20 and species
                  introductions21. However, it remains unclear which global
                  change drivers most increase disease and under what contexts.
                  Here we amassed a dataset from the literature that contains
                  2,938 observations of infectious disease responses to global
                  change drivers across 1,497 host-parasite combinations,
                  including plant, animal and human hosts. We found that
                  biodiversity loss, chemical pollution, climate change and
                  introduced species are associated with increases in
                  disease-related end points or harm, whereas urbanization is
                  associated with decreases in disease end points. Natural
                  biodiversity gradients, deforestation and forest fragmentation
                  are comparatively unimportant or idiosyncratic as drivers of
                  disease. Overall, these results are consistent across human
                  and non-human diseases. Nevertheless, context-dependent
                  effects of the global change drivers on disease were found to
                  be common. The findings uncovered by this meta-analysis should

                  towards global change drivers that increase disease.
                  Specifically, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, managing
                  ecosystem health, and preventing biological invasions and
                  biodiversity loss could help to reduce the burden of plant,
                  animal and human diseases, especially when coupled with

                  in need of assistance. In the absence of suitable conservation
                  interventions, they are likely to disappear soon1. There is
                  limited understanding of how and where conservation
                  interventions are applied globally, or how well they work2,3.
                  Here, using information from the International Union for
                  Conservation of Nature Red List and other global databases, we
                  find that for species at risk from three of the biggest
                  drivers of biodiversity loss—habitat loss, overexploitation
                  for international trade and invasive species4—many appear to
                  lack the appropriate types of conservation interventions.
                  Indeed, although there has been substantial recent expansion
                  of the protected area network, we still find that 91\% of
                  threatened species have insufficient representation of their
                  habitats within protected areas. Conservation interventions
                  are not implemented uniformly across different taxa and
                  regions and, even when present, have infrequently led to
                  substantial improvements in the status of species. For 58\% of
                  the world’s threatened terrestrial species, we find
                  conservation interventions to be notably insufficient or
                  absent. We cannot determine whether such species are truly
                  neglected, or whether efforts to recover them are not included
                  in major conservation databases. If they are indeed neglected,
                  the outlook for many of the world’s threatened species is grim
                  without more and better targeted action.},

                  disturbance propagation among species. However, our
                  comprehension of assemblage mechanisms and disturbance
                  propagation in food webs is limited by the multitude of
                  stressors affecting ecosystems, impairing ecosystem
                  management. By analysing directional food web components
                  connecting species along food chains, we show that increasing
                  species richness and constant feeding linkage density promote
                  the establishment of predictable food web structures, in which
                  the proportion of species co-present in one or more food

                  models (HSM) can inform forest managers to aim their

                  tigers by providing information regarding the scale-dependent
                  habitat-species relationships. However the current gap of
                  knowledge about ecological relationships driving species
                  distribution reduces the applicability of traditional and
                  classical statistical approaches such as generalized linear
                  models (GLMs), or occupancy surveys to produce accurate
                  predictive maps. This study investigates the multi-scale
                  habitat relationships of tigers and leopards and the impacts
                  of future climate change on their distribution using a
                  machine-learning algorithm random forest (RF). The recent
                  advancements in the machine-learning algorithms provide a
                  powerful tool for building accurate predictive models of
                  species distribution and their habitat relationships even when

                  collected species occurrence data using camera traps and
                  indirect evidence of animal presences (scats) in the field
                  over 2 years of rigorous sampling and used a machine-learning

                  suitability maps of tiger and leopard under current and future
                  climatic scenarios. We developed niche overlap models based on
                  the recently developed statistical approaches to assess the
                  patterns of niche similarity between tigers and leopards.
                  Tiger and leopard utilized habitat resources at the broadest
                  spatial scales (28,000 m). Our model predicted a 23\% loss in
                  the suitable habitat of tigers under the RCP 8.5 Scenario
                  (2050). Our study of multi-scale habitat suitability modeling

                  their binding annotation to their host receptor. The proposed

                  distinguishes, with high accuracy, the binding potential among
                  coronaviruses. Three viruses, previously unknown to bind human

                  richness in wildlife hosts have been proposed, their relative
                  importance has not been formally examined. This hampers our
                  ability to identify potential disease reservoirs, particularly
                  in remote areas with limited surveillance efforts. Here we
                  analyzed 14 proposed predictors of pathogen richness using
                  ensemble modeling and a dataset of 1040 host species to
                  identify the most important predictors of pathogen richness in
                  wild mammal species. After controlling for research effort,
                  larger species geographic range area was identified to be
                  associated with higher pathogen richness. We found evidence of
                  duality in the relationship between the fast–slow continuum of
                  life-history traits and pathogen richness, where pathogen
                  richness increases near the extremities. Taxonomic orders

                  web ecology. The density of predator–prey links in a food web
                  (i.e., connectance) is a key measure of network complexity
                  that describes the mean proportional dietary breadth of
                  species within a food web. Connectance is a critical component
                  of food web robustness to species loss: food webs with lower
                  connectance have been shown to be more susceptible to
                  secondary extinctions. Identifying geographic variation in
                  food web connectance and its drivers may provide insight into
                  community robustness to species loss. We investigated the food
                  web connectance of ground-dwelling tropical forest mammal
                  communities in multiple biogeographic regions to test for
                  differences among regions in food web connectance and to test
                  three potential drivers: primary productivity, contemporary
                  anthropogenic pressure, and variation in mammal body mass
                  distributions reflective of historical extinctions. Mammal
                  communities from fifteen protected forests throughout the
                  Neo-, Afro-, and Asian tropics were identified from systematic
                  camera trap arrays. Predator–prey interaction data were
                  collected from published literature, and we calculated
                  connectance for each community as the number of observed
                  predator–prey links relative to the number of possible
                  predator–prey links. We used generalized linear models to test
                  for differences among regions and to identify the site level
                  characteristics that best predicted connectance. We found that
                  mammal food web connectance varied significantly among
                  continents and that body size range was the only significant
                  predictor. More possible predator–prey links were observed in
                  communities with smaller ranges in body size and therefore
                  sites with smaller body size ranges had higher mean
                  proportional dietary breadth. Specifically, mammal communities
                  in the Neotropics and in Madagascar had significantly higher
                  connectance than mammal communities in Africa. This geographic
                  variation in contemporary mammalian food web structure may be
                  the product of historical extinctions in the Late Quaternary,
                  which led to greater losses of large-bodied species in the
                  Neotropics and Madagascar thus contributing to higher average
                  proportional dietary breadth among the remaining smaller
                  bodied species in these regions.},

                  communities and power grids may be viewed as networks of
                  connected elements. Such systems can go through critical
                  transitions driven by an avalanche of contagious change. Here
                  we ask, where in a complex network such a systemic shift is
                  most likely to start. Intuitively, a central node seems the
                  most likely source of such change. Indeed, topological studies
                  suggest that central nodes can be the Achilles heel for
                  attacks. We argue that the opposite is true for the class of
                  networks in which all nodes tend to follow the state of their
                  neighbors, a category we call two-way pull networks. In this
                  case, a well-connected central node is an unlikely starting
                  point of a systemic shift due to the buffering effect of
                  connected neighbors. As a result, change is most likely to
                  cascade through the network if it spreads first among
                  relatively poorly connected nodes in the periphery. The
                  probability of such initial spread is highest when the
                  perturbation starts from intermediately connected nodes at the
                  periphery, or more specifically, nodes with intermediate
                  degree and relatively low closeness centrality. Our finding is
                  consistent with empirical observations on social innovation,
                  and may be relevant to topics as different as the sources of
                  originality of art, collapse of financial and ecological

                  apes across Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies of wild chimpanzees
                  have identified the causative agents of most respiratory
                  disease outbreaks as “common cold” paediatric human pathogens,
                  but reverse zoonotic transmission pathways have remained
                  unclear. Between May 2019 and August 2021, we conducted a
                  prospective cohort study of 234 children aged 3–11 years in
                  communities bordering Kibale National Park, Uganda, and 30
                  adults who were forest workers and regularly entered the park.
                  We collected 2047 respiratory symptoms surveys to quantify
                  clinical severity and simultaneously collected 1989
                  nasopharyngeal swabs approximately monthly for multiplex viral
                  diagnostics. Throughout the course of the study, we also
                  collected 445 faecal samples from 55 wild chimpanzees living
                  nearby in Kibale in social groups that have experienced
                  repeated, and sometimes lethal, epidemics of human-origin
                  respiratory viral disease. We characterized respiratory
                  pathogens in each cohort and examined statistical associations
                  between PCR positivity for detected pathogens and potential
                  risk factors. Children exhibited high incidence rates of
                  respiratory infections, whereas incidence rates in adults were
                  far lower. COVID-19 lockdown in 2020–2021 significantly
                  decreased respiratory disease incidence in both people and
                  chimpanzees. Human respiratory infections peaked in June and
                  September, corresponding to when children returned to school.
                  Rhinovirus, which caused a 2013 outbreak that killed 10\% of
                  chimpanzees in a Kibale community, was the most prevalent
                  human pathogen throughout the study and the only pathogen
                  present at each monthly sampling, even during COVID-19
                  lockdown. Rhinovirus was also most likely to be carried
                  asymptomatically by adults. Although we did not detect human
                  respiratory pathogens in the chimpanzees during the cohort
                  study, we detected human metapneumovirus in two chimpanzees
                  from a February 2023 outbreak that were genetically similar to
                  viruses detected in study participants in 2019. Our data
                  suggest that respiratory pathogens circulate in children and
                  that adults become asymptomatically infected during
                  high-transmission times of year. These asymptomatic adults may
                  then unknowingly carry the pathogens into forest and infect
                  chimpanzees. This conclusion, in turn, implies that
                  intervention strategies based on respiratory symptoms in
                  adults are unlikely to be effective for reducing reverse
                  zoonotic transmission of respiratory viruses to chimpanzees.},

                  Our methodology, conservation area prioritization through

                  between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity

                  with respect to mean annual temperature. We show that climate
                  change has already put ~9\% of people (>600 million) outside

                  function, ecologists seek widely applicable relationships
                  among species diversity and other ecosystem characteristics
                  such as species productivity, biomass, and abundance. These
                  metrics vary widely across ecosystems and no relationship
                  among any combination of them that is valid across habitats,
                  taxa, and spatial scales, has heretofore been found. Here we
                  derive such a relationship, an equation of state, among
                  species richness, energy flow, biomass, and abundance by
                  combining results from the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology
                  and the Metabolic Theory of Ecology. It accurately captures
                  the relationship among these state variables in 42 data sets,
                  including vegetation and arthropod communities, that span a
                  wide variety of spatial scales and habitats. The success of
                  our ecological equation of state opens opportunities for
                  estimating difficult-to-measure state variables from
                  measurements of others, adds support for two current theories
                  in ecology, and is a step toward unification in ecology.},

  abstract     = {AbstractCope’s rule posits that evolution gradually increases
                  the body size in lineages. Over the last decades, two schools
                  of thought have fueled a debate on the applicability of Cope’s
                  rule by reporting empirical evidence, respectively, for and
                  against Cope’s rule. The apparent contradictions thus
                  documented highlight the need for a comprehensive
                  process-based synthesis through which both positions of this
                  debate can be understood and reconciled. Here, we use a
                  process-based community-evolution model to investigate the
                  eco-evolutionary emergence of Cope’s rule. We report three
                  characteristic macroevolutionary patterns, of which only two
                  are consistent with Cope’s rule. First, we find that Cope’s
                  rule applies when species interactions solely depend on
                  relative differences in body size and the risk of lineage
                  extinction is low. Second, in environments with higher risk of
                  lineage extinction, the recurrent evolutionary elimination of
                  top predators induces cyclic evolution toward larger body
                  sizes, according to a macroevolutionary pattern we call the
                  recurrent Cope’s rule. Third, when interactions between
                  species are determined not only by their body sizes but also
                  by their ecological niches, the recurrent Cope’s rule may get
                  inverted, leading to cyclic evolution toward smaller body
                  sizes. This recurrent inverse Cope’s rule is characterized by
                  highly dynamic community evolution, involving the
                  diversification of species with large body sizes and the
                  extinction of species with small body sizes. To our knowledge,
                  these results provide the first theoretical foundation for
                  reconciling the contrasting empirical evidence reported on
                  body-size evolution.},

                  farinifera, a rich source of dietary minerals for wildlife,
                  was nearly extirpated from Budongo Forest, Uganda. Since then,
                  chimpanzees, black-and-white colobus, and red duiker were
                  observed feeding on bat guano, a behavior not previously
                  observed. Here we show that guano consumption may be a
                  response to dietary mineral scarcity and may expose wildlife
                  to bat-borne viruses. Videos from 2017–2019 recorded 839
                  instances of guano consumption by the aforementioned species.
                  Nutritional analysis of the guano revealed high concentrations
                  of sodium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Metagenomic
                  analyses of the guano identified 27 eukaryotic viruses,

                  outlining the importance of these developments in advancing
                  our understanding of global change. Inspired by early work on
                  biosphere–geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives
                  such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s
                  following demands for a new ‘science of the Earth’. The
                  International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme soon followed,
                  leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment
                  and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts
                  and frameworks central to the global-change discourse,
                  including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary
                  boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to
                  achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human
                  dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth
                  System. Earth System Science (ESS) has emerged as a powerful
                  tool to investigate and understand global change. This
                  Perspective outlines the history of ESS and advocates for the
                  full integration of human and biogeophysical dynamics

                  peer-reviewed literature assessments underpinned by expert

                  burning embers diagram, first used in the Third Assessment
                  Report to visualize reasons for concern, which aggregate
                  climate-change-related impacts and risks to various systems
                  and sectors. These burning embers use colour transitions to
                  show changes in the assessed level of risk to humans and
                  ecosystems as a function of global mean temperature. In this

                  the risk level at a given temperature has generally increased

                  evidence. For future assessments, an explicit, transparent and

                  response to climate change, and global temperature rise is
                  often hypothesized as the primary driver. However, the
                  directions and rates of distribution shifts are highly
                  variable across species, systems, and studies, complicating
                  efforts to manage and anticipate biodiversity responses to
                  anthropogenic change. In this Review, we summarize approaches
                  to documenting species range shifts, discuss why observed
                  range shifts often do not match our expectations, and explore
                  the impacts of species range shifts on nature and society. The
                  majority (59\%) of documented range shifts are directionally
                  consistent with climate change, based on the BioShifts
                  database of range shift observations. However, many observed
                  species have not shifted or have shifted in directions
                  opposite to temperature-based expectations. These lagging or
                  expectation-contrary shifts might be explained by additional
                  biotic or abiotic factors driving range shifts, including
                  additional non-temperature climatic drivers, habitat
                  characteristics, and species interactions, which are not
                  normally considered in range shift documentations.
                  Understanding and managing range shifts will require
                  increasing and connecting observational biological data,
                  generalizing range shift patterns across systems, and
                  predicting shifts at management-relevant timescales. Warming
                  temperatures driven by climate change are causing species
                  geographic ranges to shift, but factors such as habitat
                  characteristics and species interactions impact these changes.
                  This Review examines range shift documentation, how shifts
                  differ from temperature-based expectations, and the effects of
                  range shifts on natural and human systems.},

                  one‐ and two‐dimensional habitats. In this model, dispersal
                  evolves to avoid the competition between relatives although
                  some cost might be associated with this behaviour. The
                  evolutionarily stable dispersal distribution is characterized
                  by an equilibration of the fitness gains among all the
                  different dispersal distances. This cost‐benefit argument has
                  heuristic value and facilitates the comprehension of results
                  obtained numerically. In particular, it explains why some
                  minimal or maximal probability of dispersal may evolve at
                  intermediate distances when the cost of dispersal function is
                  an increasing function of distance. We also show that kin
                  selection may favour long range dispersal even if the survival
                  cost of dispersal is very high, provided the survival
                  probability does not vanish at long distances.},

                  the one hand, it is an increasingly formalised term that means
                  something very specific scientifically and methodologically

                  vulnerability is part of a colonial discursive framework of

                  evolves toward specialization in an environment with multiple
                  host types. We have particularly explored under which
                  conditions generalist viral strains may rise in frequency and
                  coexist with specialist strains or even dominate the
                  population. By means of a nonlinear mathematical model and
                  bifurcation analysis, we have determined the theoretical
                  conditions for stability of nine identified equilibria and
                  provided biological interpretation in terms of the infection
                  rates for the viral specialist and generalist strains. By
                  means of a stability diagram, we identified stable fixed
                  points and stable periodic orbits, as well as regions of
                  bistability. For arbitrary biologically feasible initial
                  population sizes, the probability of evolving toward stable

                  rates of the generalist and specialist strains that might lead
                  to equal chances for each type becoming the dominant strategy.
                  Furthermore, we have identified infection rates for which the

                  have been increasingly influenced by neoliberal approaches
                  since the 1990s. The authors focus on the principle of
                  transparency as a self-proclaimed basis of neoliberal
                  environmental governance, and on the role of standardized
                  science-based measurements which it purportedly affords. The
                  authors introduce the term ‘measurementality’ to signify the
                  governance logic that emerges when transparency comes to stand
                  next to effectiveness and efficiency as neoliberal principles
                  and to highlight the connections that are forged between
                  economic, managerial, and technocratic discourses. The example
                  of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
                  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is used to discuss
                  the role of measurementality in global biodiversity
                  governance. The analysis suggests that IPBES aims to
                  coordinate the science–policy interface in order to optimize
                  the generation of user-friendly knowledge of those elements of
                  biodiversity that are considered politically and economically
                  relevant: At the current economic juncture, these being in
                  essence ecosystem services. Based on these findings, the
                  authors proceed by critically reflecting on the ways in which
                  the measurementality logic of IPBES may not only result in an
                  impoverishment of the biodiversity research agenda, but also
                  in an impoverished understanding of biodiversity itself. To
                  conclude, the authors argue that measurementality is part and
                  parcel of the neoliberal paradigm in which science produces
                  the raw materials for subsequent control and exchange and
                  that, as a result, the intersection of science, discourse,
                  policy, and economics within these governance systems requires

                  analyzing rapid coevolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage and
                  bacteria in their ecological context. Bacteriophage enter host
                  cells via membrane-bound surface receptors often responsible
                  for nutrient uptake. As such, a selective pressure will exist
                  for the bacteria to modify its receptor configuration and, in
                  turn, for the phage to modify its tail fiber. A mathematical
                  model of these trait adaptations is developed by using the
                  framework of adaptive dynamics. Host strains differ in their
                  efficiency of resource uptake and resistance to phage, whereas
                  phage strains differ in their host preference for adsorption.
                  We solve the evolutionary ecology model and find the
                  conditions for coevolutionary branching and relevant
                  dimensionless parameters leading to distinct quasispecies. We
                  confirm these calculations using stochastic Monte Carlo
                  simulations of populations evolving in a chemostat with fixed
                  washout rate and inflow resource density. We find that
                  multiple quasispecies of bacteria and phage can coexist in a
                  homogeneous medium with a single resource. When
                  diversification occurs, quasispecies of phage adsorb
                  effectively to only a limited subset of the total number of
                  quasispecies of bacteria, i.e., functional differences between
                  quasispecies arise endogenously within the evolutionary
                  ecology framework. Finally, we discuss means to relate
                  predictions of this model to experimental studies in the
                  chemostat, using the model organisms Escherichia coli and the

                  the size of clearings for pasture (mean sizes, 333 and 143 ha,
                  respectively), and conversion occurred rapidly; >90\% of

                  could return to higher levels seen in 2003-2004 with a rebound
                  of crop prices in international markets. Pasture remains the
                  dominant land use after forest clearing in Mato Grosso, but
                  the growing importance of larger and faster conversion of

                  independently developed in mammals. Flight is among the most
                  energy-consuming activities. Thus, we deduced that changes in
                  energy metabolism must be a primary factor in the origin of
                  flight in bats. The respiratory chain of the mitochondrial
                  produces 95\% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) needed for
                  locomotion. Because the respiratory chain has a dual genetic
                  foundation, with genes encoded by both the mitochondrial and
                  nuclear genomes, we examined both genomes to gain insights
                  into the evolution of flight within mammals. Evidence for
                  positive selection was detected in 23.08\% of the
                  mitochondrial-encoded and 4.90\% of nuclear-encoded oxidative
                  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, but in only 2.25\% of the
                  nuclear-encoded nonrespiratory genes that function in
                  mitochondria or 1.005\% of other nuclear genes in bats. To
                  address the caveat that the two available bat genomes are of
                  only draft quality, we resequenced 77 OXPHOS genes from four
                  species of bats. The analysis of the resequenced gene data are
                  in agreement with our conclusion that a significantly higher
                  proportion of genes involved in energy metabolism, compared
                  with background genes, show evidence of adaptive evolution
                  specific on the common ancestral bat lineage. Both
                  mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes display
                  evidence of adaptive evolution along the common ancestral
                  branch of bats, supporting our hypothesis that genes involved
                  in energy metabolism were targets of natural selection and
                  allowed adaptation to the huge change in energy demand that
                  were required during the origin of flight.},

                  drives social complexity and what causes the emergence and
                  disappearance of cultural innovations. Here we analyze the
                  conditions that underlie the emergence of artificial
                  mummification in the Chinchorro culture in the coastal Atacama
                  Desert in northern Chile and southern Peru. We provide
                  empirical and theoretical evidence that artificial
                  mummification appeared during a period of increased coastal
                  freshwater availability and marine productivity, which caused
                  an increase in human population size and accelerated the
                  emergence of cultural innovations, as predicted by recent
                  models of cultural and technological evolution. Under a
                  scenario of increasing population size and extreme aridity
                  (with little or no decomposition of corpses) a simple
                  demographic model shows that dead individuals may have become
                  a significant part of the landscape, creating the conditions
                  for the manipulation of the dead that led to the emergence of
                  complex mortuary practices.},

                  epidemic to be directly estimated from sampled pathogen genome
                  sequences. By using phylogenetic history to correct for
                  spatial autocorrelation, we illustrate how a fundamental
                  spatial variable, the diffusion coefficient, can be estimated
                  using robust nonparametric statistics, and how heterogeneity
                  in dispersal can be readily quantified. We apply this
                  framework to the spread of the West Nile virus across North
                  America, an important recent instance of spatial invasion by
                  an emerging infectious disease. We demonstrate that the
                  dispersal of West Nile virus is greater and far more variable
                  than previously measured, such that its dissemination was
                  critically determined by rare, long-range movements that are
                  unlikely to be discerned during field observations. Our
                  results indicate that, by ignoring this heterogeneity,
                  previous models of the epidemic have substantially

                  and significant health burden. The spatial limits of its
                  distribution and seasonal activity are sensitive to climate
                  factors, as well as the local capacity to control the disease.
                  Malaria is also one of the few health outcomes that has been
                  modeled by more than one research group and can therefore
                  facilitate the first model intercomparison for health impacts
                  under a future with climate change. We used bias-corrected
                  temperature and rainfall simulations from the Coupled Model
                  Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models to compare the
                  metrics of five statistical and dynamical malaria impact
                  models for three future time periods (2030s, 2050s, and
                  2080s). We evaluated three malaria outcome metrics at global
                  and regional levels: climate suitability, additional
                  population at risk and additional person-months at risk across
                  the model outputs. The malaria projections were based on five
                  different global climate models, each run under four emission
                  scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) and a
                  single population projection. We also investigated the
                  modeling uncertainty associated with future projections of
                  populations at risk for malaria owing to climate change. Our

                  suitability and a net increase in the population at risk, but
                  with large uncertainties. The model outputs indicate a net

                  cycles, peaks in prey abundance precede peaks in predator
                  abundance. Such models typically assume that species life
                  history traits are fixed over ecologically relevant time
                  scales. However, the coevolution of predator and prey traits
                  has been shown to alter the community dynamics of natural
                  systems, leading to novel dynamics including antiphase and
                  cryptic cycles. Here, using an eco-coevolutionary model, we
                  show that predator-prey coevolution can also drive population
                  cycles where the opposite of canonical Lotka-Volterra
                  oscillations occurs: predator peaks precede prey peaks. These
                  reversed cycles arise when selection favors extreme

                  effective against low-offense predators. We present multiple

                  mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of
                  genome size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular
                  species. One idea is that all excess DNA is mutationally
                  hazardous, but weakly enough so that genome-size expansion
                  passively emerges in species experiencing relatively low
                  efficiency of selection owing to small effective population
                  sizes. Another idea is that substantial gene additions were
                  impossible without the energetic boost provided by the
                  colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic lineage. Contrary
                  to this latter view, analysis of cellular energetics and
                  genomics data from a wide variety of species indicates that,
                  relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a cell, the costs
                  of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels decline with
                  cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Moreover, these
                  costs are usually sufficiently large to be perceived by
                  natural selection in bacterial populations, but not in
                  eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift.
                  Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by
                  virtue of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject
                  to a broader set of opportunities for the colonization of
                  novel genes manifesting weakly advantageous or even
                  transiently disadvantageous phenotypic effects. These results
                  indicate that the origin of the mitochondrion was not a
                  prerequisite for genome-size expansion.},

                  because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as

                  cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another

                  distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that
                  the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the

  abstract     = {A wide range of research has promised new tools for
                  forecasting infectious disease dynamics, but little of that
                  research is currently being applied in practice, because tools
                  do not address key public health needs, do not produce
                  probabilistic forecasts, have not been evaluated on external
                  data, or do not provide sufficient forecast skill to be
                  useful. We developed an open collaborative forecasting
                  challenge to assess probabilistic forecasts for seasonal
                  epidemics of dengue, a major global public health problem.
                  Sixteen teams used a variety of methods and data to generate
                  forecasts for 3 epidemiological targets (peak incidence, the
                  week of the peak, and total incidence) over 8 dengue seasons
                  in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecast skill was
                  highly variable across teams and targets. While numerous
                  forecasts showed high skill for midseason situational
                  awareness, early season skill was low, and skill was generally
                  lowest for high incidence seasons, those for which forecasts
                  would be most valuable. A comparison of modeling approaches
                  revealed that average forecast skill was lower for models
                  including biologically meaningful data and mechanisms and that
                  both multimodel and multiteam ensemble forecasts consistently
                  outperformed individual model forecasts. Leveraging these
                  insights, data, and the forecasting framework will be critical
                  to improve forecast skill and the application of forecasts in
                  real time for epidemic preparedness and response. Moreover,
                  key components of this project-integration with public health
                  needs, a common forecasting framework, shared and standardized
                  data, and open participation-can help advance infectious
                  disease forecasting beyond dengue.},

                  strategy that, if adapted by a population, cannot be invaded
                  by any deviating (mutant) strategy. The concept of ESS has
                  been extensively studied and widely applied in ecology and
                  evolutionary biology [M. Smith, On Evolution (1972)] but
                  typically on the assumption that the system is ecologically
                  stable. With reference to a Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey
                  model [M. Rosenzweig, R. MacArthur, Am. Nat. 97, 209-223
                  (1963)], we derive the mathematical conditions for the
                  existence of an ESS when the ecological dynamics have
                  asymptotically stable limit points as well as limit cycles. By

                  Stenseth, J. Theoret. Biol. 108, 491-508 (1984)], we find that
                  ESSs occur at values of the evolutionary strategies that are
                  local optima of certain functions of the model parameters.
                  These functions are identified and shown to have a similar
                  form for both stable and fluctuating populations. We

                  iterative protocol in which data are collected, a model is
                  trained, and then outputs of that model are used to choose
                  what data to consider next. For example, a data-driven
                  approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model
                  to predict the fitness of protein sequences and then use it to
                  propose new sequences believed to exhibit greater fitness than
                  observed in the training data. Since validating designed
                  sequences in the wet laboratory is typically costly, it is
                  important to quantify the uncertainty in the model's
                  predictions. This is challenging because of a characteristic
                  type of distribution shift between the training and test data
                  that arises in the design setting-one in which the training
                  and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is
                  chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model's error on
                  the test data-that is, the designed sequences-has an unknown
                  and possibly complex relationship with its error on the
                  training data. We introduce a method to construct confidence
                  sets for predictions in such settings, which account for the
                  dependence between the training and test data. The confidence
                  sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for
                  any regression model, even when it is used to choose the
                  test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we use
                  real datasets to demonstrate how our method quantifies
                  uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins and
                  can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve
                  acceptable tradeoffs between high predicted fitness and low
                  predictive uncertainty.},

                  to address the many challenges associated with the biosphere
                  in the Anthropocene. Consequently, the critical question
                  becomes: How can science most rapidly progress to address
                  large, complex global problems? We suggest that the lag in the
                  development of a more predictive science of the biosphere is
                  not only because the biosphere is so much more complex, or
                  because we do not have enough data, or are not doing enough
                  experiments, but, in large part, because of unresolved tension
                  between the three dominant scientific cultures that pervade
                  the research community. We introduce and explain the concept
                  of the three scientific cultures and present a novel analysis
                  of their characteristics, supported by examples and a formal
                  mathematical definition/representation of what this means and
                  implies. The three cultures operate, to varying degrees,
                  across all of science. However, within the biosciences, and in
                  contrast to some of the other sciences, they remain relatively
                  more separated, and their lack of integration has hindered
                  their potential power and insight. Our solution to
                  accelerating a broader, predictive science of the biosphere is
                  to enhance integration of scientific cultures. The process of
                  integration—Scientific Transculturalism—recognizes that the
                  push for interdisciplinary research, in general, is just not
                  enough. Unless these cultures of science are formally
                  appreciated and their thinking iteratively integrated into
                  scientific discovery and advancement, there will continue to
                  be numerous significant challenges that will increasingly
                  limit forecasting and prediction efforts.},

                  to know whether a taxon is thriving or declining to
                  extinction. For parasites of wildlife, there are few long-term
                  data-a gap that creates an impediment to managing parasite
                  biodiversity and infectious threats in a changing world. We
                  produced a century-scale time series of metazoan parasite
                  abundance and used it to test whether parasitism is changing
                  in Puget Sound, United States, and, if so, why. We performed
                  parasitological dissection of fluid-preserved specimens held
                  in natural history collections for eight fish species
                  collected between 1880 and 2019. We found that parasite taxa
                  using three or more obligately required host species-a group
                  that comprised 52\% of the parasite taxa we detected-declined
                  in abundance at a rate of 10.9\% per decade, whereas no change
                  in abundance was detected for parasites using one or two
                  obligately required host species. We tested several potential
                  mechanisms for the decline in 3+-host parasites and found that
                  parasite abundance was negatively correlated with sea surface
                  temperature, diminishing at a rate of 38\% for every 1 °C
                  increase. Although the temperature effect was strong, it did
                  not explain all variability in parasite burden, suggesting
                  that other factors may also have contributed to the long-term
                  declines we observed. These data document one century of
                  climate-associated parasite decline in Puget Sound-a massive

                  high niche availability associated with the diversity of host
                  plants and dense niche packing due to host partitioning among
                  herbivores. However, the relative contributions of these two
                  factors to dynamics in the diversity of herbivores throughout

                  the predictability of individual outcomes). Here, we show that
                  this can lead to sizable misperceptions about the implications
                  of scientific results. Specifically, we present three
                  preregistered, randomized experiments where participants saw
                  the same scientific findings visualized as showing only
                  inferential uncertainty, only outcome variability, or both and

                  mammals is in part the result of a long-term evolutionary
                  process. Reconstructing the deep phylogenetic histories of
                  viruses helps identify major evolutionary transitions and
                  contextualizes the emergence of viruses in new hosts. We used
                  a combination of total RNA sequencing and transcriptome data
                  mining to extend the diversity and evolutionary history of the
                  RNA virus order Articulavirales, which includes the influenza
                  viruses. We identified instances of Articulavirales in the
                  invertebrate phylum Cnidaria (including corals), constituting
                  a novel and divergent family that we provisionally named the
                  "Cnidenomoviridae." We further extended the evolutionary
                  history of the influenza virus lineage by identifying four
                  divergent, fish-associated influenza-like viruses, thereby
                  supporting the hypothesis that fish were among the first hosts
                  of influenza viruses. In addition, we substantially expanded
                  the phylogenetic diversity of quaranjaviruses and proposed
                  that this genus be reclassified as a family-the
                  "Quaranjaviridae." Within this putative family, we identified
                  a novel arachnid-infecting genus, provisionally named
                  "Cheliceravirus." Notably, we observed a close phylogenetic
                  relationship between the Crustacea- and Chelicerata-infecting
                  "Quaranjaviridae" that is inconsistent with virus-host
                  codivergence. Together, these data suggest that the
                  Articulavirales has evolved over at least 600 million years,
                  first emerging in aquatic animals. Importantly, the evolution
                  of the Articulavirales was likely shaped by multiple
                  aquatic-terrestrial transitions and substantial host jumps,
                  some of which are still observable today.},

                  uncovered in Chinese bats, raising concerns about their threat
                  to public health. Here, we describe a long-term surveillance
                  to track bat FiVs at orchards, eventually resulting in the
                  identification and isolation of a FiV, Dehong virus (DEHV),
                  from Rousettus leschenaultii bats. DEHV has a typical
                  filovirus-like morphology with a wide spectrum of cell
                  tropism. Its entry into cells depends on the engagement of
                  Niemann-Pick C1, and its replication is inhibited by
                  remdesivir. DEHV has the largest genome size of filoviruses,
                  with phylogenetic analysis placing it between the genera
                  Dianlovirus and Orthomarburgvirus , suggesting its
                  classification as the prototype of a new genus within the
                  family Filoviridae . The continuous detection of viral RNA in
                  the serological survey, together with the wide host
                  distribution, has revealed that the region covering southern
                  Yunnan, China, and bordering areas is a natural circulation
                  sphere for bat FiVs. These emphasize the need for a better
                  understanding of the pathogenicity and potential risk of FiVs

                  expected accuracy of baseline maps that can have two types of
                  randomness: (1) random distribution of the quantity of each
                  category and (2) random spatial allocation of the categories.
                  Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in
                  remote sensing and other fields. This article examines five
                  different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the
                  first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties
                  mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically,
                  with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and
                  the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to
                  the estimated population matrix. This article concludes that
                  these Kappa indices are useless, misleading and/or flawed for
                  the practical applications in remote sensing that we have
                  seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices,
                  we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa
                  indices for purposes of accuracy assessment and map
                  comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix
                  with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity
                  disagreement and allocation disagreement. This article shows
                  how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from
                  peer-reviewed literature.},

                  behavioral innovations in the flagship species of animal
                  culture, the common chimpanzee. Although social learning of

                  argue that these findings lack ecological validity and

                  individually to unspecified environmental differences, rather
                  than learning from each other. In a recent paper, we used

                  transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted and vector-borne

                  function of the population disease frequency. In an extension

                  probability function that assumes that the chance of becoming
                  infected increases with the number of vector contacts.
                  Stability analyses show that host-pathogen coexistence is
                  possible in vector-transmitted and sexually transmitted
                  disease systems in which transmission is likely to be

                  frequency-dependent model to allow for multiple contacts among
                  hosts indicates that parameter ranges within which coexistence

                  different life cycles, modes of density regulation,
                  variance-covariance structures, and trade-off strengths. A
                  particular feature of our analysis is the investigation of
                  arbitrary trade-off functions. We find that local-adaptation
                  evolution qualitatively changes the outcome of habitat-choice
                  evolution under a wide range of conditions. In addition,
                  habitat-choice evolution qualitatively and invariably changes
                  the outcomes of local-adaptation evolution whenever trade-offs
                  are weak. Even weak trade-offs, which favor generalists when

                  adaptation and habitat choice are both allowed to evolve.
                  Unless trapped by maladaptive genetic constraints, joint
                  evolution of local adaptation and habitat choice in the models
                  analyzed here thus always leads to specialists, independent of

                  raising the bar for evolutionarily sound explanations of

                  evolve depends on the life cycle and the mode of density
                  regulation. Finally, we explain why the gradual evolutionary
                  emergence of coexisting specialists requires more restrictive
                  conditions than does their evolutionarily stable maintenance.},

                  particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference
                  between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical
                  species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer
                  to the temperature at which fitness is maximized (T(opt)) and
                  an upper temperature limit for survival (T(max)) that is
                  closer to T(opt) than do temperate species. Thus, even a small
                  increase in environmental temperature could put tropical
                  ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate
                  ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this
                  pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are
                  not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework
                  to partition the temperature response of fitness into its
                  components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test
                  model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness
                  declines at high temperatures because the temperature
                  responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways:
                  fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed
                  the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase.
                  The proximity of T(opt) to T(max) depends on how the
                  temperature response of development mediates the interaction
                  between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly
                  temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only
                  after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which
                  causes fitness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures
                  exceed T(opt). The model correctly predicts empirically
                  observed fitness-temperature relationships in insects from
                  different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the
                  widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the
                  latitudinal differences in fitness responses.},

                  aegypti, has recently evolved to specialize in biting and
                  living alongside humans. It prefers human odor over the odor
                  of nonhuman animals and breeds in human-provided artificial
                  containers rather than the forest tree holes of its ancestors.
                  Here, we report one way this human specialist has adapted to
                  the distinct ecology of human environments. While eggs of the
                  ancestral subspecies rarely hatch in pure water, those of the
                  derived human specialist do so readily. We trace this novel
                  behavior to a shift in how eggs respond to dissolved oxygen,
                  low levels of which may signal food abundance. Moreover, we
                  show that while tree holes are consistently low in dissolved
                  oxygen, artificial containers often have much higher levels.
                  There is thus a concordance between the hatching behavior of
                  each subspecies and the aquatic habitat it uses in the wild.
                  We find this behavioral variation is heritable, with both
                  maternal and zygotic effects. The zygotic effect depends on
                  dissolved oxygen concentration (i.e., a genotype-environment
                  interaction, or G×E), pointing to potential changes in
                  oxygen-sensitive circuits. Together, our results suggest that
                  a shift in hatching response contributed to the pernicious
                  success of this human-specialist mosquito and illustrate how
                  animals may rapidly adapt to human-driven changes in the
                  environment.},

                  change with additional warming above pre-industrial levels,
                  generally accompanied by a figure called the burning embers.
                  We present a first effort to develop burning embers for
                  climate change risks for heat-related morbidity and mortality,
                  ozone-related mortality, malaria, diseases carried by Aedes
                  sp., Lyme disease, and West Nile fever. We used an
                  evidence-based approach to construct the embers based on a
                  comprehensive global literature review. Projected risks for
                  these health outcomes under 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and >2 °C of warming
                  were used to estimate at what temperatures risk levels
                  increased from undetectable to medium, high, and very high,
                  from the pre-industrial baseline, under three adaptation
                  scenarios. Recent climate change has likely increased risks
                  from undetectable to moderate for heat-related morbidity and
                  mortality, ozone-related mortality, dengue, and Lyme disease.
                  Recent climate change also was assessed as likely beginning to
                  affect the burden of West Nile fever. A detectable impact of
                  climate change on malaria is not yet apparent but is expected

                  topics, it remains unclear how synthesis has affected the
                  discipline. Using a case study of publications (n = 2304) from
                  the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
                  compared with papers with similar keywords from the Web of
                  Science (n = 320,000), we address several questions about the
                  comparative impact of synthesis, the role of synthesis in
                  driving key research themes, and whether synthesis is focused
                  on different topics than is the broader ecological literature.
                  We found much higher citation rates for synthesis papers

                  (e.g., species richness, biodiversity, climate change, global

                  expanding, motivated in part by concerns around emerging
                  zoonoses. One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus
                  association data, which underpin viral macroecology and
                  zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous
                  data portals. In the present article, we propose that
                  synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to
                  characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory
                  in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open
                  database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles
                  four published data sets. We show that this offers a
                  substantially richer view of the known virome than any

                  these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery
                  accelerates. We argue for a shift in practice toward the
                  development, incremental updating, and use of synthetic data
                  sets in viral ecology, to improve replicability and facilitate

                  different people in different contexts. I organize and explain
                  this diversity by addressing five questions. What does it mean
                  to predict something? To answer this question, I describe
                  concepts of prediction as prophecy, diagnosis, history,
                  repeatability, and fate. What are we trying to predict? Here,
                  I describe how predictions vary along several axes: general to
                  specific, qualitative to quantitative, relative to absolute,
                  point to range, and continuous to discontinuous. Where do
                  predictions come from? In this case, I focus on deductive
                  versus inductive reasoning. How do we test predictions? The
                  answer here is not straightforward and I discuss various
                  approaches and difficulties. How good are predictions? Not
                  surprisingly, it depends on what is being predicted and how we
                  judge success. Importantly, I do not espouse a “best” way to

                  evaluated the potential for geographic, taxonomic, and
                  citation biases in publications between temperate and tropical
                  systems for nine broad topics in ecology and evolutionary
                  biology. Across 1,800 papers sampled from 60,000
                  peer-reviewed, empirical studies, we found consistent patterns
                  of bias in the form of increased numbers of studies in
                  temperate systems. Tropical studies were nearly absent from
                  some topics. Furthermore, there were strong taxonomic biases

                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic

                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions

                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and

                  populations can strongly impact the spread of endemic
                  pathogens. In plants, recent work has shown that
                  within-population variation in resistance can also affect the
                  transmission of foreign spillover pathogens if that resistance
                  is general. However, most hosts also possess specific
                  resistance mechanisms that provide strong defenses against
                  coevolved endemic pathogens. Here we use a modeling approach
                  to ask how antagonistic coevolution between hosts and their
                  endemic pathogen at the specific resistance locus can affect
                  the frequency of general resistance, and therefore a host’s
                  vulnerability to foreign pathogens. We develop a two-locus
                  model with variable recombination that incorporates both
                  general resistance (effective against all pathogens) and
                  specific resistance (effective against endemic pathogens
                  only). With coevolution, when pathogens can evolve to evade
                  specific resistance, we find that the regions where general
                  resistance can evolve are greatly expanded, decreasing the
                  risk of foreign pathogen invasion. Furthermore, coevolution
                  greatly expands the conditions that maintain polymorphisms at
                  both resistance loci, thereby driving greater genetic
                  diversity within host populations. This genetic diversity
                  often leads to positive correlations between host resistance

                  natural populations. However, if resistance loci become

                  pathogen can mold the resistance structure of host populations
                  in ways that affect its susceptibility to foreign pathogen
                  spillovers, and that the nature of these outcomes depends on
                  resistance costs, as well as the degree of linkage between
                  resistance genes.},

                  experiments with the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
                  Based on the patterns of shared allele frequency changes that

                  experimental location, we found adaptive evolution to be more

                  colonization than in the spread phase, when populations expand

                  provides a route for rapid evolution if the benefits outweigh
                  the cost. We recently showed that genetic background
                  significantly influences how yeast cells respond to gene
                  overexpression, revealing that the fitness costs of
                  copy-number variation can vary substantially with genetic
                  background in a common-garden environment. But the interplay
                  between copy-number variation tolerance and environment
                  remains unexplored on a genomic scale. Here, we measured the
                  tolerance to gene overexpression in four genetically distinct
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains grown under sodium chloride
                  stress. Overexpressed genes that are commonly deleterious
                  during sodium chloride stress recapitulated those commonly
                  deleterious under standard conditions. However, sodium
                  chloride stress uncovered novel differences in strain
                  responses to gene overexpression. West African strain NCYC3290
                  and North American oak isolate YPS128 are more sensitive to
                  sodium chloride stress than vineyard BC187 and laboratory
                  strain BY4743. Consistently, NCYC3290 and YPS128 showed the
                  greatest sensitivities to overexpression of specific genes.
                  Although most genes were deleterious, hundreds were beneficial
                  when overexpressed-remarkably, most of these effects were
                  strain specific. Few beneficial genes were shared between the
                  sodium chloride-sensitive isolates, implicating mechanistic
                  differences behind their sodium chloride sensitivity.
                  Transcriptomic analysis suggested underlying vulnerabilities
                  and tolerances across strains, and pointed to natural
                  copy-number variation of a sodium export pump that likely
                  contributes to strain-specific responses to overexpression of

                  However, these traits-gamete type, chromosomal inheritance,
                  physiology, morphology, behavior, etc.-are not necessarily
                  coupled, and the rhetorical collapse of variation into a
                  single term elides much of the complexity inherent in sexual
                  phenotypes. We argue that consideration of "sex" as a

                  opens up new avenues for inquiry in our study of biological

                  sexual phenotypes to the evolutionary and ecological
                  consequences of intrasexual polymorphisms. We argue that
                  instead of assuming binary sex in these systems, some may be
                  better categorized as multivariate and nonbinary. Finally, we

                  cloud, studies of sexual diversity within and across species.
                  We argue that such an expanded framework of "sex" better
                  equips us to understand evolutionary processes, and that as

                  aspects of the life of vertebrates and hence understanding how
                  it varies between species is crucial. Mammalian home range
                  size has been linked to body size and diet, but these studies
                  were based predominantly on terrestrial species and most
                  specifically excluded bats. As the only group of flying
                  mammals, bats experience distinctly different constraints on
                  movement, and hence home range. However, despite their
                  diversity, relatively little is known about the home ranges of
                  bats, and this is the first global review assessing correlates
                  of their home range size. Our hypothesis is that home range
                  will be impacted by different ecological conditions
                  experienced by the bats and by the biological traits of the
                  bats themselves. We performed a meta-analysis based on
                  published data for 81 bat species to identify variables that
                  contribute most to home range size. Sex, wing loading,
                  functional group, colony size, dietary class, distance from
                  the equator (latitudinal region), habitat type, and the

                  all important explanatory variables. Wing loading was
                  positively correlated with home range size—while females,
                  open-air foragers, large colony sizes, and bats in temperate
                  regions consistently had large home ranges. Understanding the
                  correlates of home range has important implications, for
                  example, for bat conservation and for assessing the risk of
                  spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans and

                  this century, accelerating without effective global efforts to
                  reduce emissions. Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are
                  inherently climate-sensitive due to the sensitivity of tick
                  lifecycles to climate. Key direct climate and weather
                  sensitivities include survival of individual ticks, and the
                  duration of development and host-seeking activity of ticks.
                  These sensitivities mean that in some regions a warming
                  climate may increase tick survival, shorten life-cycles and
                  lengthen the duration of tick activity seasons. Indirect
                  effects of climate change on host communities may, with
                  changes in tick abundance, facilitate enhanced transmission of
                  tick-borne pathogens. High temperatures, and extreme weather
                  events (heat, cold, and flooding) are anticipated with climate
                  change, and these may reduce tick survival and pathogen
                  transmission in some locations. Studies of the possible
                  effects of climate change on TTBDs to date generally project
                  poleward range expansion of geographical ranges (with possible
                  contraction of ranges away from the increasingly hot tropics),
                  upslope elevational range spread in mountainous regions, and
                  increased abundance of ticks in many current endemic regions.
                  However, relatively few studies, using long-term
                  (multi-decade) observations, provide evidence of recent range
                  changes of tick populations that could be attributed to recent
                  climate change. Further integrated 'One Health' observational
                  and modeling studies are needed to detect changes in TTBD
                  occurrence, attribute them to climate change, and to develop
                  predictive models of public- and animal-health needs to plan
                  for TTBD emergence.},

                  such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of
                  neutral mutations the original function is distributed between
                  two partially functional and complementary genes, and
                  neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of
                  the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in
                  another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on
                  the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends
                  on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications.
                  Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined
                  gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid.
                  Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra

                  pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15\%.

                  and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset

                  explicitly statistical perspective, using stochastic models to
                  describe the evolution of species range as a continuous-time
                  Markov process of dispersal between and extinction within a
                  set of discrete geographic areas. The main constraint of these
                  methods is the computational limit on the number of areas that
                  can be specified. We propose a Bayesian approach for inferring
                  biogeographic history that extends the application of
                  biogeographic models to the analysis of more realistic
                  problems that involve a large number of areas. Our solution is
                  based on a "data-augmentation" approach, in which we first
                  populate the tree with a history of biogeographic events that
                  is consistent with the observed species ranges at the tips of
                  the tree. We then calculate the likelihood of a given history
                  by adopting a mechanistic interpretation of the
                  instantaneous-rate matrix, which specifies both the
                  exponential waiting times between biogeographic events and the
                  relative probabilities of each biogeographic change. We
                  develop this approach in a Bayesian framework, marginalizing
                  over all possible biogeographic histories using Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides dramatically increasing the number
                  of areas that can be accommodated in a biogeographic analysis,
                  our method allows the parameters of a given biogeographic
                  model to be estimated and different biogeographic models to be

                  in the development of generic software for simulation and
                  statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to
                  graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard
                  graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics.
                  We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to
                  capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding
                  to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic
                  models using the graphical model framework and introduce
                  modules to simplify the representation of standard components
                  in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be
                  readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and
                  Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings or

                  period in mosquitoes, increases human transmission, and plays
                  a critical role in outbreak dynamics. In the present study, we
                  looked at the effect of temperature in altering the virus
                  virulence. We found that DENV cultured at a higher temperature
                  in C6/36 mosquito cells was significantly more virulent than
                  the virus grown at a lower temperature. In a mouse model, the
                  virulent strain induced enhanced viremia and aggressive
                  disease with a short course, hemorrhage, severe vascular

                  responses to unusual, novel or complex socioecological
                  challenges. This buffer effect should increase survival rates

                  behavioural patterns and that this ability helps dealing with

                  are actually visited by a smaller subset of available
                  pollinator species has not been broadly evaluated. We compiled
                  53 609 floral visitation records in 159 communities and
                  classified the plants' floral symmetry. Globally and within

                  indeed visited by fewer species. At the same time, zygomorphic

                  species with different properties adjusted their populations
                  to the changing external environment. So far, this ideal world

                  it would be desirable to have a real, biological

                  assumptions are included in the contact rate between
                  infectious and susceptible individuals. However, adaptive
                  behaviours are expected to emerge and play an important role
                  in the transmission dynamics across populations. Here, we
                  propose a theoretical framework to couple transmission
                  dynamics with behavioural dynamics due to infection awareness.
                  We modelled the dynamics of social behaviour using a game
                  theory framework, which is then coupled with an
                  epidemiological model that captures the disease dynamics by
                  assuming that individuals are aware of the actual
                  epidemiological state to reduce their contacts. Results from
                  the mechanistic model show that as individuals increase their
                  awareness, the steady-state value of the final fraction of
                  infected individuals in a susceptible-infected-susceptible

                  networks, having the awareness parameter dependent on global

                  time-series are of different lengths. Here, we present a
                  general approach for studying the dynamic structure of such
                  interactions. Specifically, we analyse the recruitment of the
                  world's largest cod stock, the Northeast Arctic cod. Studies
                  based on data starting in the 1970-1980s indicate that this
                  stock is affected by temperature through a variety of
                  pathways. However, the value of such studies is somewhat
                  limited by the fact that they are based on a quite specific
                  ecological and climatic situation. Recently, this stock has
                  consisted of fairly young fish and the spawning stock has
                  consisted of relatively few age groups. In this study, we
                  develop a model for the effect of capelin (the cod's main
                  prey) and herring on cod recruitment since 1973. Based on this
                  model, we analyse data on cod, herring and temperature going
                  back to 1921 and find that food-web effects explain a
                  significant part of the cod recruitment variation back to
                  around 1950.},

                  the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to
                  host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents,
                  another important host order. We found that bats indeed host
                  more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we
                  identified life-history and ecological factors that promote
                  zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by
                  species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of
                  other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry).
                  Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased
                  zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one
                  young), greater longevity and more litters per year.
                  Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain
                  in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the
                  stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared
                  between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission
                  is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats
                  host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of
                  zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in
                  rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the
                  number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents
                  should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging
                  viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and
                  perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive
                  framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus

                  recognize unknown competent reservoirs using three disease

                  investigated using trait evolutionary models which assume that
                  lineages evolve independently from each other. Consequently,
                  the role of species interactions in driving macroevolutionary
                  dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify the

                  species in the evolution of ecomorphological traits across the

                  patterns of phenotypic diversification, and that other
                  selection pressures may predominantly shape ecomorphological

                  We found positive relationships between population genetic
                  structure and diversification for both beetles and spiders.
                  Comparisons between dispersive and non-dispersive lineages
                  revealed significant differences for both lineage
                  differentiation and diversification. For both taxa,
                  non-dispersive lineages had stronger population genetic
                  structure. Genus-level endemic species richness and proxies
                  for diversification rate within genera were higher in
                  non-dispersive taxa for both beetles and spiders. Comparisons
                  of average and maximum node divergences within genera suggest
                  that species turnover may be higher in non-dispersive genera.
                  Our results reveal a model where dispersal limitation may
                  shape the diversity of lineages across evolutionary timescales
                  by positively influencing intraspecific and species diversity,
                  moderated by higher extinction rates compared to more

                  unknown, especially for multi-trophic interactions. We here
                  collected a large dataset consisting of 2670 observations of
                  tri-trophic interactions among plants, sap-sucking aphids and
                  honeydew-collecting ants on 18 forested islands in the
                  Thousand Island Lake, China. For each island, we constructed
                  an antagonistic plant–aphid and a mutualistic aphid–ant
                  network, and tested how network specialization varied with
                  island area and isolation. We found that both networks
                  exhibited higher specialization on smaller islands, while only
                  aphid–ant networks had increased specialization on more
                  isolated islands. Variations in network specialization among
                  islands was primarily driven by species turnover, which was
                  interlinked across trophic levels as fragmentation increased
                  the specialization of both antagonistic and mutualistic
                  networks through bottom-up effects via plant and aphid
                  communities. These findings reveal that species on small and
                  isolated islands display higher specialization mainly due to
                  effects of fragmentation on species turnover, with behavioural
                  changes causing interaction rewiring playing only a minor
                  role. Our study highlights the significance of adopting a

                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and

                  habitats most effectively promote and prevent biological
                  invasions. Here, we integrate models of network structure and
                  nonlinear population dynamics to search for potential
                  generalities among trophic factors that may drive invasion
                  success and failure. We simulate invasions where 100 different
                  species attempt to invade 150 different food webs with 15-26
                  species and a wide range (0.06-0.32) of connectance. These
                  simulations yield 11 438 invasion attempts by non-basal
                  species, 47 per cent of which are successful. At the time of
                  introduction, whether or not the invader is a generalist best
                  predicts final invasion success; however, once the invader
                  establishes itself, it is best distinguished from unsuccessful
                  invaders by occupying a lower trophic position and being
                  relatively invulnerable to predation. In general, variables
                  that reflect the interaction between an invading species and
                  its new community, such as generality and trophic position,
                  best predict invasion success; however, for some trophic
                  categories of invaders, fundamental species traits, such as
                  having the centre of the feeding range low on the theoretical
                  niche axis (for non-omnivorous and omnivorous herbivores), or
                  the topology of the food web (for tertiary carnivores), best
                  predict invasion success. Across all invasion scenarios, a
                  discriminant analysis model predicted successful and failed
                  invasions with 76.5 per cent accuracy for properties at the
                  time of introduction or 100 per cent accuracy for properties
                  at the time of establishment. More generally, our results

                  (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation
                  policy, invasive species management and disease-control
                  measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the
                  degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we
                  review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty,
                  focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models,
                  demographic models and process-based models. We identify
                  sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how
                  uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling
                  process to give realistic measures of confidence around
                  predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we
                  conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been
                  underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions
                  of geographical distribution. We identify areas where

                  hierarchical models that link different types of distribution
                  model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales.
                  Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible
                  methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying
                  model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of

                  relative frequencies may change over time. Three nested
                  subtypes of populational models can be distinguished:
                  evolutionary, selectional and replicative. Substantial
                  progress has been made in the study of cultural evolution by
                  modelling it within the selectional frame. This progress has
                  involved idealizing away from phenomena that may be critical
                  to an adequate understanding of culture and cultural
                  evolution, particularly the constructive aspect of the
                  mechanisms of cultural transmission. Taking these aspects into
                  account, we describe cultural evolution in terms of cultural
                  attraction, which is populational and evolutionary, but only
                  selectional under certain circumstances. As such, in order to
                  model cultural evolution, we must not simply adjust existing
                  replicative or selectional models but we should rather
                  generalize them, so that, just as replicator-based selection
                  is one form that Darwinian selection can take, selection
                  itself is one of several different forms that attraction can
                  take. We present an elementary formalization of the idea of

                  biodiversity targets. Changes in species diversity and high
                  rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide.
                  In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these
                  trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A
                  formal framework and guidelines for the detection and
                  attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an
                  inferential framework to guide detection and attribution
                  analyses, which identifies five steps-causal modelling,
                  observation, estimation, detection and attribution-for robust
                  attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity
                  change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple
                  potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from
                  contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible

                  methods for trend detection and attribution have been
                  deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data
                  and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best
                  practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate

                  impacts through company provision of information is a
                  precursor to holding them accountable for nature outcomes. The
                  effect of increasing disclosures (of varying quality) is
                  predicated on ‘information governance’, an approach that uses
                  disclosure requirements to drive company behaviour. However,
                  its efficacy is not guaranteed. We argue that three conditions
                  are required before disclosures have the possibility to shape
                  nature outcomes, namely: (1) radical traceability that links
                  company actions to outcomes in particular settings; (2)

                  ambitions. While disclosure is key to each of these
                  conditions, its limits must be taken into account and it must

                  reverse this clock a further 50 Myr by 2100. We aimed to
                  answer two essential questions to better understand the
                  changes in ecosystems worldwide owing to predicted climate
                  change. Firstly, we identify the locations and time frames
                  where novel ecosystems could emerge owing to climate change.
                  Secondly, we aim to determine the extent to which biomes, in
                  their current distribution, will experience an increase in
                  climate-driven ecological novelty. To answer these questions,
                  we analysed three perspectives on how climate changes could
                  result in novel ecosystems in the near term (2100), medium
                  (2200) and long term (2300). These perspectives included
                  identifying areas where climate change could result in new
                  climatic combinations, climate isoclines moving faster than
                  species migration capacity and current environmental patterns
                  being disaggregated. Using these metrics, we determined when
                  and where novel ecosystems could emerge. Our analysis shows
                  that unless rapid mitigation measures are taken, the coverage
                  of novel ecosystems could be over 50\% of the land surface by
                  2100 under all change scenarios. By 2300, the coverage of
                  novel ecosystems could be above 80\% of the land surface. At
                  the biome scale, these changes could mean that over 50\% of
                  locations could shift towards novel ecosystems, with the
                  majority seeing these changes in the next few decades. Our
                  research shows that the impact of climate change on ecosystems
                  is complex and varied, requiring global action to mitigate and

                  Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and
                  ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods
                  to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large
                  natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as
                  gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological
                  relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to
                  result in accurate predictions of the distribution and
                  abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous
                  assessments of the theoretical advantages of these
                  methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare
                  the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to
                  identify environmental features that explain observed
                  variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged

                  boosted and linear models use similar environmental features
                  to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted
                  models found non-linear relationships and interactions that
                  are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify

                  reduction technique that is known for being simple and easy to
                  interpret. Principal components are often interpreted as
                  low-dimensional patterns in high-dimensional data. However,
                  this simple interpretation of PCA relies on several unstated
                  assumptions that are difficult to satisfy. When these
                  assumptions are violated, non-oscillatory data may have
                  oscillatory principal components. Here, we show that two
                  common properties of data violate these assumptions and cause
                  oscillatory principal components: smooth-ness, and shifts in
                  time or space. These two properties implicate almost all
                  neuroscience data. We show how the oscillations that they
                  produce, which we call “phantom oscillations”, impact data
                  analysis. We also show that traditional cross-validation does
                  not detect phantom oscillations, so we suggest procedures that
                  do. Our findings are supported by a collection of mathematical
                  proofs. Collectively, our work demonstrates that patterns
                  which emerge from high-dimensional data analysis may not

                  recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population
                  surveys4to investigate whether human-caused climate change has
                  increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan
                  Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a
                  robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation,
                  consistent with expectations from previous empirical and
                  epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate
                  reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without
                  anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that
                  human-caused climate change has increased the overall
                  prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa
                  since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate
                  change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of
                  malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher
                  elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa
                  having greater increases. Under future climate change, we
                  project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the
                  eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the
                  present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide
                  average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions,
                  SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per
                  100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find
                  that limiting future global warming to below 2°C (SSP1-RCP2.6)
                  compared to∼3°C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496

                  aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size)
                  of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically
                  documented human visual preferences and investigated whether

                  changes in ecological and evolutionary observations through
                  time. We begin with an intuitive explanation of predictability
                  (that is, the extent to which predictions are possible)
                  employing an easy-to-use metric, predictive powerPP(t). To
                  illustrate the challenge of forecasting, we then show that
                  among insects, birds, fishes, and mammals (i) 50\% of the
                  populations are predictable at most one year in advance, and
                  (ii) the median one-year-ahead predictive power corresponds to
                  a sobering predictionR2of approximately 20\%. Nonetheless,
                  predictability is not an immutable property of ecological
                  systems. For example, different harvesting strategies can

                  incorporating explanatory variables or accounting for time

                  phage-bacteria interactions have been mostly focusing on a few
                  model organisms to understand the molecular mechanisms which
                  makes a particular bacterial strain susceptible to a given
                  phage. However, both bacteria and phages are extremely diverse
                  in natural contexts. How well the concepts learned from
                  well-established experimental models generalize to a broad
                  diversity of what is encountered in the wild is currently
                  unknown. Recent advances in genomics allow to identify traits
                  involved in phage-host specificity, implying that these traits
                  could be utilized for the prediction of such interactions.
                  Here, we show that we could predict outcomes of most
                  phage-bacteria interactions at the strain level in Escherichia
                  natural isolates based solely on genomic data. First, we
                  established a dataset of experimental outcomes of
                  phage-bacteria interactions of 403 natural, phylogenetically
                  diverse, Escherichia strains to 96 bacteriophages matched with
                  fully sequenced and genomically characterized strains and
                  phages. To predict these interactions, we set out to define
                  genomic traits with predictive power. We show that most
                  interactions in our dataset can be explained by adsorption
                  factors as opposed to antiphage systems which play a marginal
                  role. We then trained predictive algorithms to pinpoint which
                  interactions could be accurately predicted and where future
                  research should focus on. Finally, we show the application of
                  such predictions by establishing a pipeline to recommend
                  tailored phage cocktails to target pathogenic strains from
                  their genomes only and show higher efficiency of tailored

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTInfluenza A viruses in swine have considerable genetic
                  diversity and continue to pose a pandemic threat to humans.
                  They were the source of the most recent influenza pandemic,
                  and since 2010, novel swine viruses have spilled over into
                  humans more than 400 times in the United States. Although
                  these zoonotic infections generally result in mild illness
                  with limited onward human transmission, the potential for
                  sustained transmission of an emerging influenza virus between
                  individuals due to lack of population level immunity is of
                  great concern. Compiling the literature on pandemic threat
                  assessment, we established a pipeline to characterize and
                  triage influenza viruses for their pandemic risk and examined
                  the pandemic potential of two widespread swine origin viruses.
                  Our analysis revealed that a panel of human sera collected
                  from healthy adults in 2020 has no cross-reactive neutralizing
                  antibodies against an α-H1 clade strain but do against a γ-H1
                  clade strain. Swine H1N2 virus from the α-H1 clade (α-swH1N2)
                  replicated efficiently in human airway cultures and exhibited
                  phenotypic signatures similar to the human H1N1 pandemic
                  strain from 2009 (H1N1pdm09). Furthermore, α-swH1N2 was
                  capable of efficient airborne transmission to both naïve
                  ferrets and ferrets with prior seasonal influenza immunity.
                  Ferrets with H1N1pdm09 pre-existing immunity had reduced
                  α-swH1N2 viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract and
                  cleared the infection faster. Despite this, H1N1pdm09-immune
                  ferrets that became infected via the air could still onward
                  transmit α-swH1N2 with an efficiency of 50\%. Taken together,
                  these results indicate that this α-swH1N2 strain has a higher
                  pandemic potential, but a moderate level of impact since there
                  is reduced replication fitness in animals with prior immunity.},

                  health, with dengue representing a growing concern due to its
                  high existing burden and sensitivity to climatic conditions.
                  Yet, the quantitative impacts of temperature warming on
                  dengue, both in the past and in the future, remain poorly
                  understood. In this study, we quantify how dengue responds to
                  climatic fluctuations, and use this inferred temperature
                  response to estimate the impacts of historical warming and
                  forecast trends under future climate change scenarios. To
                  estimate the causal impact of temperature on the spread of
                  dengue in the Americas and Asia, we assembled a dataset
                  encompassing nearly 1.5 million dengue incidence records from
                  21 countries. Our analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship
                  between temperature and dengue incidence with the largest
                  marginal effects at lower temperatures (around 15°C), peak
                  incidence at 27.8°C (95\% CI: 27.3 - 28.2°C), and subsequent
                  declines at higher temperatures. Our findings indicate that
                  historical climate change has already increased dengue
                  incidence 18\% (12 - 25\%) in the study region, and
                  projections suggest a potential increase of 40\% (17 - 76) to
                  57\% (33 - 107\%) by mid-century depending on the climate
                  scenario, with some areas seeing up to 200\% increases.
                  Notably, our models suggest that lower emissions scenarios
                  would substantially reduce the warming-driven increase in
                  dengue burden. Together, these insights contribute to the
                  broader understanding of how long-term climate patterns
                  influence dengue, providing a valuable foundation for public
                  health planning and the development of strategies to mitigate
                  future risks due to climate change.},

                  knowledge of the global loss of biodiversity, has been
                  experiencing rapid growth in recent decades. The increasing
                  difficulty to synthesise this literature manually has
                  simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text
                  mining methods. Within the domain of deep learning, large
                  language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable
                  attention in recent years by virtue of great leaps in progress
                  and a wide range of potential applications, however,
                  quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has
                  so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of
                  GPT-4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest
                  controllers from abstracts of a body of literature on
                  biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero-shot prompt.
                  Our results show that the performance of GPT-4 is highly
                  competitive with other state-of-the-art tools used for
                  taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location
                  extraction tasks. On a held-out test set, we show that species
                  and geographic locations are extracted with F1-scores of
                  99.8\% and 95.3\%, respectively, and highlight that the model
                  is able to distinguish very effectively between the primary
                  roles of interest (predators, parasitoids and pests).
                  Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the model to
                  effectively extract and predict taxonomic information across
                  various taxonomic ranks, and to automatically correct spelling
                  mistakes. However, we do report a small number of cases of
                  fabricated information (hallucinations). As a result of the
                  current lack of specialised, pre-trained ecological language
                  models, general-purpose LLMs may provide a promising way
                  forward in ecology. Combined with tailored prompt engineering,
                  such models can be employed for a wide range of text mining
                  tasks in ecology, with the potential to greatly reduce time
                  spent on manual screening and labelling of the literature.},

                  Early and efficient vaccination can contain outbreaks and
                  prevent mass mortality, but optimal vaccine stockpiling
                  strategies are dependent on pathogen characteristics,
                  reservoir ecology, and epidemic dynamics. Here, we model major
                  regional outbreaks of Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory
                  syndrome, and use these to develop a generalized framework for
                  estimating vaccine stockpile needs based on spillover
                  geography, spatially-heterogeneous healthcare capacity and
                  spatially-distributed human mobility networks. Because
                  outbreak sizes were highly skewed, we found that most
                  outbreaks were readily contained (median stockpile estimate
                  for MERS-CoV: 2,089 doses; Nipah: 1,882 doses), but the
                  maximum estimated stockpile need in a highly unlikely large

                  (MERS-CoV: ~87,000 doses; Nipah ~1.1 million doses).
                  Sensitivity analysis revealed that stockpile needs were more
                  dependent on basic epidemiological parameters (i.e., death and
                  recovery rate) and healthcare availability than any
                  uncertainty related to vaccine efficacy or deployment
                  strategy. Our results highlight the value of descriptive
                  epidemiology for real-world modeling applications, and suggest

                  non-equilibrium conditions, such as climate and land-use
                  changes or invasive species. Their consideration of underlying
                  mechanisms relaxes the species-environment equilibrium assumed
                  by correlative approaches, while also generating
                  conservation-relevant indicators, such as range-wide abundance
                  time-series and migration rates if demographically explicit.
                  However, the computational complexity of mechanistic models
                  limits their development and applicability to large
                  spatiotemporal extents.We developed the R package ‘metaRange’
                  that is a modular framework to build population-based and
                  metabolically constrained range models. It provides a function
                  catalogue for users to calculate niche-based suitability,
                  metabolic scaling, population dynamics, biotic interactions,
                  and kernel-based dispersal, which may include directed
                  movement. The framework’s modularity enables the user to
                  combine, extend, or replace these functions, making it
                  possible to customize the model to the ecology of the study
                  system. The package supports an unlimited number of static or
                  dynamic environmental factors as input, including climate and
                  land use.As an example, we simulated 100 virtual species in
                  Germany on a 1 km2resolution over 110 years under realistic
                  environmental fluctuations in three scenarios: without
                  competition, with competition, and with competition and a
                  generalist-specialist trade-off. The results are in accordance
                  with theoretical expectations. Due to the population-level,
                  the package can execute such extensive simulation experiments
                  on regular enduser hardware in a short amount of time. We
                  provide detailed technical documentation, both for the
                  individual functions in the package as well as instructions on
                  how to set up different types of model structures and

                  interacting species on a high resolution and low computational
                  demand. We believe that it allows for theoretical insights and
                  hypotheses testing about future range dynamics of real-world
                  species, which may better support conservation policies

                  capacity of the main infected host species but also, in some

                  Our approaches substantially boosted our model performance.
                  This enhancement was particularly notable in segmented RNA
                  viruses, which are involved with severe zoonoses but have been
                  overlooked due to limited data availability. Furthermore,
                  models trained on data up to 2018 displayed strong
                  generalization capability for viruses emerging post-2018.
                  Nonetheless, we also found remaining challenges in alerting
                  the zoonotic potential of specific viral lineages, including
                  SARS-CoV-2. Our study elaborates on the models and datasets
                  for predicting viral infectivity and highlights the unresolved

                  future zoonotic threats. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement

                  (HPIAV) has been detected in dairy cows in the United States.
                  Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded,
                  RNA virus that has not previously been associated with
                  widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an
                  extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV
                  receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound
                  to galactose in either an α2,3 or α2,6 linkage. Human IAVs
                  preferentially bind SA-α2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian
                  IAVs have a preference for α2,3 (avian receptor). The avian
                  receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs
                  isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to
                  SA-α2,3-Gal-β1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated
                  from duck to SA-α2,3-Gal-β1,3 (duck receptor). We found all
                  receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the
                  mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or
                  dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely
                  expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken
                  receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a
                  low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of
                  the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale
                  for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine
                  milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing
                  vessel for novel IAV generation.},

                  that emerged in domestic waterfowl in 1996. Over the past
                  decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans,
                  has been reported. Although human to human transmission is
                  rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who
                  have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing
                  presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises
                  substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically
                  naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.
                  Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was
                  historically used to track polio and has recently been
                  implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing
                  approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in
                  nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in
                  the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April
                  25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered
                  all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade
                  2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one
                  detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over
                  seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests
                  avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially
                  humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of
                  wastewater sequencing to track avian influenza.},

                  (absent much clearer reasons for concern) the suggested

                  mutualisms, form the architecture of biodiversity and
                  determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules
                  responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the
                  functional consequences of these interspecific interactions,
                  is central to predict community dynamics and stability.
                  Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological
                  processes by determining species interactions through a
                  two‐step process. First, ecological and life‐history traits
                  govern species distributions and abundance, and hence
                  determine species co‐occurrence and the potential for species
                  to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits
                  between co‐occurring potential interaction partners should
                  match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review
                  recent advances on predicting interactions from species
                  co‐occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring
                  trait matching. The models proposed here integrate both
                  neutral and trait‐matching constraints, while using only
                  information about known interactions, thereby overcoming
                  problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions
                  (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative
                  or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation
                  within species, such as values that vary along developmental
                  stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies
                  to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait
                  matching (e.g. predator–prey system), relaxed trait matching
                  (e.g. herbivore–plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g.
                  plant–pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species
                  traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining
                  interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in
                  explaining how species interact and the consequences of these

                  sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories.
                  Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links)
                  within diversified ecological networks require adequate
                  sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we
                  still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological
                  interactions. While the complete inventory of interactions is
                  likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main
                  patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must
                  acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of
                  interactions among, say, A animal species and P plant species
                  (i.e. ) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, that
                  is life‐history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed
                  interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically ,
                  resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.
                  Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for
                  interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to
                  individuals and species sampling, thus extending
                  diversity‐monitoring approaches to the characterization of
                  complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to
                  species inventories, a sizable fraction of non‐observed
                  pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological
                  constraints that forbid their occurrence. Reasons for
                  forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and
                  temporal uncoupling, size mismatches and intrinsically low
                  probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential
                  interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the
                  completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus
                  needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so
                  that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the
                  unobserved links when addressing sampling effort. Recent
                  implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or
                  for individual‐based data can be combined with the assessment
                  of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative
                  importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic
                  estimate of interaction richness in a robustly sampled
                  assemblage and the maximum richness of interactions. This is
                  crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of
                  defaunation‐driven loss of key ecological interactions and the
                  services they provide and the analogous losses related to
                  interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic

                  reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is
                  considered under threat due to reported bee declines.
                  Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators
                  and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural
                  systems, they are poorly studied. Here, we investigated the
                  relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic
                  land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local
                  plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local
                  flower visitor networks and related network architecture to
                  these local and landscape factors using structural equation
                  modelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often
                  assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to
                  pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator‐dependent
                  plant species. Overall, local land use markedly influenced
                  plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee
                  richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas.
                  Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density)
                  increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a
                  site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower
                  visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher
                  number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban
                  flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a
                  lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher
                  specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network
                  specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related
                  to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather,
                  it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance
                  and bee richness that were positively related to pollination.
                  Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant
                  and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction
                  networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and
                  pollination services to our experimental plants in urban
                  compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower
                  visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics
                  were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential
                  facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee
                  communities for pollination. A lay summary is available for

                  with predators consuming increasingly larger prey and feeding
                  at higher trophic levels as they grow. Gape limitation and
                  ontogenetic diet shifts are key mechanisms by which size
                  structuring arises in these communities. Little is known,
                  however, about size structuring in coral reef fishes. Here, we
                  aimed to advance understanding of size structuring in coral
                  reef food webs by examining the evidence for these mechanisms
                  in two groups of reef predators. Given the diversity of
                  feeding modes amongst coral reef fishes, we also compared gape
                  size-body size allometric relationships across functional
                  groups to determine whether they are reliable indicators of
                  size structuring. We used gut content analysis and quantile
                  regressions of predator size-prey size relationships to test
                  for evidence of gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts
                  in reef piscivores (n = 13 species) and benthic invertivores
                  (n = 3 species). We then estimated gape size-body size
                  allometric scaling coefficients for 21 different species from
                  four functional groups, including herbivores/detritivores,
                  which are not expected to be gape-limited. We found evidence
                  of both mechanisms for size structuring in coral reef
                  piscivores, with maximum prey size scaling positively with
                  predator body size, and ontogenetic diet shifts including prey
                  type and expansion of prey size. There was, however, little
                  evidence of size structuring in benthic invertivores. Across
                  species and functional groups, absolute and relative gape
                  sizes were largest in piscivores as expected, but gape
                  size-body size scaling relationships were not indicative of
                  size structuring. Instead, relative gape sizes and mouth
                  morphologies may be better indicators. Our results provide
                  evidence that coral reef piscivores are size-structured and
                  that gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts are the
                  mechanisms from which this structure arises. Although gape
                  allometry was not indicative of size structuring, it may have
                  implications for ecosystem function: positively allometric
                  gape size-body size scaling relationships in
                  herbivores/detritivores suggests that loss of large-bodied
                  individuals of these species will have a disproportionately
                  negative impact on reef grazing pressure.},

                  not benefit from systematic long-term monitoring programmes,
                  leaving gaps in our current knowledge of climate-induced
                  community turnover. We used data extracted from the Global
                  Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize community
                  reorganization under climate change for nine animal taxonomic
                  groups (ants, bats, bees, birds, butterflies, earthworms,
                  frogs, rodents and salamanders), which, for most of them, had
                  never been studied before in this regard. Using a
                  presence-only community temperature index (CTI), reflecting
                  the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, we
                  tested whether and how species' assemblages were affected by
                  climate change over the last 30 years. Across Europe and North
                  America, we observed an average increase in CTI, consistent
                  with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. At
                  the local scale, we could observe that the composition of most
                  species assemblages changed according to temperature
                  variations. However, this change in composition always
                  occurred with a lag compared to climate change, suggesting
                  that communities are experiencing a climatic debt. Results
                  suggest that anthropization may play a role in the decoupling
                  between the change in CTI and the change in local temperature.
                  The results of our study highlight an overall
                  thermophilization of assemblages as a response of temperature
                  warming. We demonstrated that this response may exist for a
                  large range of understudied terrestrial animals, and we
                  introduced a framework that can be used in a broader context,

  abstract     = {1.The exponential growth of scientific literature—which we
                  call the “big literature” phenomenon—has created great
                  challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The
                  traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often
                  unable to take advantage of big literature due to human
                  limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new
                  literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. 2.In
                  this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis
                  approach, Automated Content Analysis (ACA), which has not yet
                  been widely adopted in the fields of ecological and
                  evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine-learning tools
                  for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big
                  literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical
                  research. 3.Our goal is to introduce ecologists and
                  evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to
                  synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we
                  provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the
                  fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies
                  to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in
                  synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally,
                  we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of
                  ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to
                  advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary
                  research. 4.Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA
                  is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially
                  shorter timespans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The
                  overall efficiency and versatility of this method allows for a
                  broad range of applications for literature review and
                  synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic
                  reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By
                  allowing for more extensive and comprehensive review of big
                  literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important
                  methodological gap and to therefore contribute to the

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

  abstract     = {Summary A primary goal of ecology is to understand the
                  fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions
                  of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling
                  and community ecology – approach this problem differently.
                  Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs)
                  to quantify the relationship between species’ and their
                  environments without considering potential biotic
                  interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to
                  focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies,
                  use co‐occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes.
                  Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM)
                  that integrates these distinct observational approaches by
                  incorporating species co‐occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs
                  estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and
                  allow decomposition of species co‐occurrence patterns into
                  components describing shared environmental responses and
                  residual patterns of co‐occurrence. We provide a general
                  description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the
                  model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two
                  case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia.
                  Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than
                  residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there
                  were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species
                  generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to
                  the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were
                  not fully described by the environmental variables included in
                  the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar
                  environmental responses but had negative residual
                  co‐occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species
                  may not form stable assemblages despite having similar
                  environmental affinities. Environmental and residual
                  correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether
                  co‐occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or
                  other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic
                  interactions), or if important predictor variables are
                  missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions
                  of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a
                  major limitation of modelling species distributions
                  independently.},

                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  single agency issues that require intervention or monitoring
                  at one spatial scale. A master sample can be used to
                  coordinate and scale monitoring designs to ensure consistency
                  in information gathered and robustness of estimators at the
                  different spatial scales. We propose using balanced acceptance
                  sampling (BAS) to generate a master sample. In this context,
                  practical applications and justification of BAS as a master
                  sample are addressed. These include sample generation,
                  stratification, unequal probability sampling, rotating panel
                  designs, and regional intensification. A method for
                  incorporating legacy sites is also provided. Using BAS as a
                  master sample is conceptually simple, gives good spatial
                  balance over different spatial scales, and is computationally
                  efficient to generate. An example for terrestrial biodiversity
                  monitoring in New Zealand is provided. Environmental
                  monitoring can benefit from increased coordination between
                  agencies. A master sample is an excellent way to incorporate
                  coordination directly into the sample design. BAS improves on
                  methods previously described and provides an effective method
                  to monitor populations at multiple spatial scales.},

                  that has been rarely applied to ecological problems. Like
                  other classification and regression tree methods, BART
                  estimates the probability of a binary outcome based on a set
                  of decision trees. Unlike other methods, BART iteratively
                  generates sets of trees based on a set of priors about tree
                  structure and nodes, and builds a posterior distribution of
                  estimated classification probabilities. So far, BARTs have yet
                  to be applied to SDM. embarcadero is a workflow wrapper for

                  10 fossil occurrences are randomly drawn from their respective
                  fossil records. ENphylo proved significantly more accurate
                  than ENFA and the ensemble of bivariate models using Maxent,
                  Generalized Linear Model and Random Forest algorithms.
                  Intriguingly, we found that randomly drawing as little as 10
                  occurrence data points per species allows ENphylo to perform
                  equally well as Maxent run using the entire fossil record of
                  these same species and data. ENphylo provides a fast and
                  accurate solution to perform species distribution modelling
                  with rare species, which will help predicting their
                  distribution in the light of climate change, and to delineate

                  momentum as a way to circumvent limitations in data volume.
                  Yet, ecological networks are challenging to predict because
                  they are typically small and sparse. Dealing with extreme
                  class imbalance is a challenge for most binary classifiers,
                  and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
                  models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple
                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

                  often lack suitable parametric representations to portray
                  them. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) provide a
                  way of estimating interactions non‐parametrically from
                  time‐series data. NODEs, however, are slow to fit, and
                  inferred interactions usually are not compared with the ground
                  truth. We provide a fast NODE fitting method, Bayesian neural
                  gradient matching (BNGM), which relies on interpolating time
                  series with neural networks and fitting NODEs to the
                  interpolated dynamics with Bayesian regularisation. We test
                  the accuracy of the approach by inferring ecological
                  interactions in time series generated by an ODE model with
                  known interactions. We compare these results against three
                  existing approaches for estimating ecological interactions,
                  standard NODEs, ODE models and convergent cross‐mapping (CCM).
                  We also infer interactions in experimentally replicated time
                  series of a microcosm featuring an algae, flagellate and
                  rotifer population, in the hare and lynx system, and the
                  Maizuru Bay community featuring 11 species. Our BNGM approach
                  allows us to reduce the fitting time of NODE systems to only a
                  few seconds and provides accurate estimates of ecological
                  interactions in the artificial system, as true ecological
                  interactions are recovered with minimal error. Our benchmark
                  analysis reveals that our approach is both faster and more
                  accurate than standard NODEs and parametric ODEs, while CCM
                  was found to be faster but less accurate. The analysis of the
                  replicated time series reveals that only the strongest
                  interactions are consistent across replicates, while the
                  analysis of the Maizuru community shows the strong negative
                  impact of the chameleon goby on most species of the community,
                  and a potential indirect negative effect of temperature by
                  favouring goby population growth. Overall, NODEs alleviate the
                  need for a mechanistic understanding of interactions, and BNGM
                  alleviates the heavy computational cost. This is a crucial
                  step availing quick NODE fitting to larger systems,
                  cross‐validation and uncertainty quantification, as well as
                  more objective estimation of interactions, and complex context
                  dependence, than parametric models.},

                  distribution of species using occurrence data and
                  environmental variables. While data on species presence are
                  increasingly accessible, the difficulty of confirming real
                  absences in the field often forces researchers to generate
                  them in silico. To this aim, pseudo‐absences are commonly
                  sampled randomly across the study area (i.e. the geographical
                  space). However, this introduces sample location bias (i.e.
                  the sampling is unbalanced towards the most frequent habitats
                  occurring within the geographical space) and favours class
                  overlap (i.e. overlap between environmental conditions
                  associated with species presences and pseudo‐absences) in the
                  training dataset. To mitigate this, we propose an alternative
                  methodology (i.e. the uniform approach) that systematically
                  samples pseudo‐absences within a portion of the environmental
                  space delimited by a kernel‐based filter, which seeks to
                  minimise the number of false absences included in the training
                  dataset. We simulated 50 virtual species and modelled their
                  distribution using training datasets assembled with the
                  presence points of the virtual species and pseudo‐absences
                  collected using the uniform approach and other approaches that
                  randomly sample pseudo‐absences within the geographical space.
                  We compared the predictive performance of habitat suitability
                  models and evaluated the extent of sample location bias and
                  class overlap associated with the different sampling
                  strategies. Results indicated that the uniform approach: (i)
                  effectively reduces sample location bias and class overlap;
                  (ii) provides comparable predictive performance to sampling
                  strategies carried out in the geographical space; and (iii)
                  ensures gathering pseudo‐absences adequately representing the
                  environmental conditions available across the study area. We
                  developed a set of R functions in an accompanying R package

                  compositions (i.e. ecological uniqueness) is crucial to
                  understanding the mechanisms underpinning diversity patterns
                  and for effective conservation planning. Environmental
                  conditions are often sampled differentially in datasets, which
                  can lead to rarer environments having unique species
                  compositions, provided that environmental differences increase
                  compositional differences. This effect, however, will be
                  undesirable when a study aims to test the direct impact of
                  environments rather than their availability. We developed an
                  approach to reduce the effects of environmental availability
                  in ecological uniqueness analyses through calculating expected
                  pairwise compositional dissimilarities for each unique
                  environmental condition. We further used simulations to assess
                  the performance of our methods by randomly generating
                  communities from two hypothetical environments with
                  non‐overlapping species pools. Additionally, we used a dataset
                  of 50 tree communities to demonstrate how environmental
                  availability could impact relationships between environmental
                  conditions and ecological uniqueness in empirical studies. Our
                  simulations revealed that uniqueness metrics based on observed
                  values are sensitive to environmental availability, while our
                  approach correctly concluded that there were no differences
                  among environments under the unbalanced design. Our analysis
                  of tree communities produced divergent conclusions between the
                  two approaches, as increasing slope reduced ecological
                  uniqueness after controlling for their low availability in the
                  dataset only. This suggests that low environmental
                  availability inflated the ecological uniqueness of sites with
                  high slope, which opposed its direct negative effects on
                  ecological uniqueness, leading to a weak relationship based on
                  observed values. To achieve a more mechanistic understanding
                  of ecological uniqueness patterns, the effects of
                  environmental availability must be considered. We recommend
                  that studies use both uncorrected and corrected analyses to
                  identify not only the direct effects of environmental
                  conditions but also the degree to which their availability
                  influences the observed relationships between ecological
                  uniqueness and environment conditions. Our approach should be
                  most necessary and applicable in unbalanced designs, which is
                  a common characteristic in empirical studies.},

                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and

                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the

  abstract     = {Abstract There are two distinct approaches to describing the
                  distributions of biomass and species in food webs: one to
                  consider them as discrete trophic levels (TLs); and the other
                  to consider them as continuous trophic positions (TPs).
                  Bridging the gap between these two perspectives presents a
                  nontrivial challenge in integrating biodiversity and food‐web
                  structure. Food network unfolding (FNU) is a technique used to
                  bridge this gap by partitioning the biomass of species into
                  integer TLs to compute three complexity indices, namely
                  vertical (DV), horizontal (DH) and range (DR) diversity (D
                  indices), through decomposition of Shannon's index H′. Using
                  FNU, the food web (a network of species with unique TPs) is
                  converted to a linear food chain (a biomass distribution at
                  discrete TLs). This enables us to expect that the unfolded
                  biomass within species decreases exponentially as the TL
                  increases. Under this condition, the mean TL value in unfolded
                  food chains is hypothesized to have an exponential
                  relationship with the vertical diversity, DV. To explore this,
                  we implemented FNU and calculated D indices for food webs
                  publicly available at EcoBase (n = 158) and calculated the
                  integrated TP (iTP), defined as the biomass‐weighted average
                  TP of a given food web. The iTP corresponds to the mean TL in
                  unfolded food chains and can be empirically measured through
                  compound‐specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA‐AA).
                  Although our analysis is biased towards marine ecosystems, we
                  revealed an exponential relationship between iTP and DV,
                  suggesting that iTP can serve as a measurable proxy for DV.
                  Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the iTP
                  observed in the total communities (total iTP) and the iTPs of
                  partial communities consisting only of species with 2.0 ≤ TP
                  r2 = 0.48), suggesting that DV can be predicted using partial
                  iTP. Our findings suggest that the net effect of species
                  diversity, excluding the effect of biomass (corresponding to
                  H′ − DV), on food‐web complexity can be revealed by combining
                  CSIA‐AA with biodiversity analysis (e.g. environmental DNA).},

                  Circular statistics (e.g. Rayleigh test or Hermans‐Rasson
                  test) provide useful approaches for doing so based on the
                  number of individuals that exhibit particular activities
                  during a number of time intervals. This study used monthly
                  reproductive activity as an example to illustrate problems in
                  applying circular statistics to data when marginal totals
                  characterize experimental designs (e.g. the number of
                  reproductively active individuals per time interval depends on
                  sampling effort or sampling success). We illustrate the nature

                  developing a bootstrapping simulation procedure to overcome
                  complications that arise from the existence of marginal
                  totals. In addition, we apply circular statistics and our
                  bootstrapping simulation to empirical data on the reproductive
                  phenology of six species of Neotropical bats from the Amazon.
                  Because sampling effort or success can differ among time
                  intervals, circular statistics can produce misleading results
                  of two types: those suggesting uniform phenologies when
                  empirical patterns are markedly modal, and those suggesting
                  non‐uniform phenologies when empirical patterns are uniform.
                  The bootstrapping simulation overcomes these limitations: the
                  exemplar phenology in which the percentage of reproductively
                  active individuals is modal is appropriately identified as
                  non‐uniform based on the bootstrapping approach, and the
                  exemplar phenology in which the percentage of reproductively
                  active individuals is invariant is appropriately identified as
                  uniform based on the bootstrapping approach. The reproductive
                  phenology of each of the six empirical examples is non‐uniform
                  based on the bootstrapping approach, and this is true for bats
                  species with unimodal peaks or bimodal peaks. In addition to
                  problems with marginal totals, a review of analyses of
                  phenological patterns in ecology identified two other frequent
                  issues in the application of circular statistics: sampling
                  bias and pseudoreplication. Each of these issues and potential
                  solutions are also discussed. By providing source code for the
                  execution of the Rayleigh test and Hermans‐Rasson test, along
                  with the code for the bootstrapping simulation, we offer a
                  useful tool for assessing non‐random phenologies when marginal
                  totals characterize experimental designs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Species distribution modelling is a highly used tool
                  for understanding and predicting biodiversity change, and
                  recent work has emphasised the importance of understanding how
                  species distributions change over both time and space.
                  Spatio‐temporal models require large amounts of data spread
                  over time and space, and as such are clear candidates to
                  benefit from model‐based integration of different data
                  sources. However, spatio‐temporal models are highly
                  computationally intensive and integrating different data
                  sources can make this approach even more unfeasible to
                  ecologists. Here we demonstrate how the R‐INLA methodology can
                  be used for model‐based data integration for spatio‐temporally
                  explicit modelling of species distribution change. We
                  demonstrate that this method can be applied to both point and
                  areal data with two contrasting case studies, one using the
                  SPDE approach for modelling spatio‐temporal change in the
                  Gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus) across Great Britain
                  and the second using a spatio‐temporal areal model to describe
                  change in caddisfly (Trichoptera) populations across the River
                  Thames catchment. We show that in the caddisfly case study
                  integrating together different data sources led to greater
                  understanding of the change in abundance across the River
                  Thames both seasonally and over 5 years of data. However, in
                  the butterfly case study moving to a spatio‐temporal context
                  exacerbated differences between the data sources and resulted
                  in no greater ecological insight into change in the Gatekeeper
                  population. Our work provides a computationally feasible
                  framework for spatio‐temporally explicit integration of data
                  within SDMs and demonstrates both the potential benefits and
                  the challenges in applying this methodology to real ecological
                  data.},

  abstract     = {Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains
                  challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing
                  biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential
                  Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure
                  biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and
                  standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to
                  capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study,
                  report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the
                  challenges of a 'Big Data' approach to building global EBV
                  data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing
                  on species distribution and abundance. The majority of
                  currently available data on species distributions derives from
                  incidentally reported observations or from surveys where
                  presence-only or presence-absence data are sampled repeatedly
                  with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from
                  opportunistic population counts or from population time series
                  using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the
                  same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous
                  complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous,
                  multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different
                  sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV
                  data products requires correcting biases introduced by
                  imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with
                  different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing
                  measurement units from different data sources or sampling
                  methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial
                  inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of
                  uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the
                  development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations
                  Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key
                  workflow steps that will operationalize the process of
                  building EBV data products within and across research
                  infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple
                  sequential activities into account, including identification
                  and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality
                  control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of
                  integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete
                  examples from existing citizen science and professional
                  monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology
                  Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and
                  the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow
                  steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems
                  and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales.
                  They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we
                  provide an overview of current data and metadata standards.
                  Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV
                  data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining
                  heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in
                  geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating
                  emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as
                  citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and
                  satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues
                  related to data product structure, data storage, execution of
                  workflows and the production process/cycle as well as
                  approaching technical interoperability among research
                  infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by
                  developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing
                  consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal
                  interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free
                  from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing
                  these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for
                  assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and
                  sustainable development goals.},

  abstract     = {Plant-hummingbird interactions are considered a classic
                  example of coevolution, a process in which mutually dependent
                  species influence each other's evolution. Plants depend on
                  hummingbirds for pollination, whereas hummingbirds rely on
                  nectar for food. As a step towards understanding coevolution,
                  this review focuses on the macroevolutionary consequences of
                  plant-hummingbird interactions, a relatively underexplored
                  area in the current literature. We synthesize prior studies,
                  illustrating the origins and dynamics of hummingbird
                  pollination across different angiosperm clades previously
                  pollinated by insects (mostly bees), bats, and passerine
                  birds. In some cases, the crown age of hummingbirds pre-dates
                  the plants they pollinate. In other cases, plant groups
                  transitioned to hummingbird pollination early in the
                  establishment of this bird group in the Americas, with the
                  build-up of both diversities coinciding temporally, and hence
                  suggesting co-diversification. Determining what triggers
                  shifts to and away from hummingbird pollination remains a
                  major open challenge. The impact of hummingbirds on plant
                  diversification is complex, with many tropical plant lineages
                  experiencing increased diversification after acquiring flowers
                  that attract hummingbirds, and others experiencing no change
                  or even a decrease in diversification rates. This mixed
                  evidence suggests that other extrinsic or intrinsic factors,
                  such as local climate and isolation, are important covariables
                  driving the diversification of plants adapted to hummingbird
                  pollination. To guide future studies, we discuss the
                  mechanisms and contexts under which hummingbirds, as a clade
                  and as individual species (e.g. traits, foraging behaviour,
                  degree of specialization), could influence plant evolution. We
                  conclude by commenting on how macroevolutionary signals of the
                  mutualism could relate to coevolution, highlighting the
                  unbalanced focus on the plant side of the interaction, and
                  advocating for the use of species-level interaction data in
                  macroevolutionary studies.},

                  often involve some degree of projection into novel covariate
                  space (i.e. extrapolation), because calibration data may not
                  encompass the entire space of interest. Most methods for
                  identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each model
                  covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that
                  is well within the range of univariate variation, but which
                  exhibits novel combinations between covariates. Our objective
                  was to develop a tool that can detect, distinguish and
                  quantify these two types of novelties: novel univariate range
                  and novel combinations of covariates.LocationGlobal,

                  measures the similarity between the reference and projection
                  domains by accounting for both the deviation from the mean and

                  intricate network of interactions between them. Because of
                  their overall complexity, an intriguing approach to
                  understanding network structure is by breaking it down into
                  the structural roles of its constituent species. The
                  structural role of a species can be directly measured based on
                  how it appears in network motifs – the basic building blocks
                  of complex networks. Here, we study the distribution of
                  species’ roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e.
                  species, network, and temporal) in host–parasitoid networks
                  collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented
                  landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species’
                  roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously
                  distributed across the study system but that roles are
                  strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found
                  that species’ roles were remarkably consistent between years
                  even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover).
                  Overall, our results suggest that species’ roles are an
                  intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over
                  spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract     = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical
                  (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern
                  statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such
                  dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these
                  structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious
                  underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor
                  performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted
                  often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that
                  persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating
                  the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because
                  often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample
                  opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This
                  problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive
                  models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used.
                  Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically
                  rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the
                  blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in
                  space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while
                  accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly
                  induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or
                  combinations of predictor variables available for model
                  training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the
                  other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also
                  improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling
                  goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random
                  and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a
                  series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that,
                  for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly
                  universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if
                  the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for
                  selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block
                  cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist
                  in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in
                  the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account
                  for such correlations.},

                  almost every dimension of modern biology, from natural
                  selection and speciation to invasive species and biodiversity
                  management. However, biogeography has rarely been integrated
                  into human or veterinary medicine nor routinely leveraged for
                  global health management. Here we review the theory and
                  application of biogeography to the research and management of
                  human infectious diseases, an integration we refer to as
                  'pathogeography'. Pathogeography represents a promising
                  framework for understanding and decomposing the spatial
                  distributions, diversity patterns and emergence risks of human
                  infectious diseases into interpretable components of dynamic
                  socio-ecological systems. Analytical tools from biogeography
                  are already helping to improve our understanding of individual
                  infectious disease distributions and the processes that shape
                  them in space and time. At higher levels of organization,
                  biogeographical studies of diseases are rarer but increasing,
                  improving our ability to describe and explain patterns that
                  emerge at the level of disease communities (e.g.
                  co-occurrence, diversity patterns, biogeographic
                  regionalisation). Even in a highly globalized world most human
                  infectious diseases remain constrained in their geographic
                  distributions by ecological barriers to the dispersal or
                  establishment of their causal pathogens, reservoir hosts
                  and/or vectors. These same processes underpin the spatial
                  arrangement of other taxa, such as mammalian biodiversity,
                  providing a strong empirical 'prior' with which to assess the
                  potential distributions of infectious diseases when data on
                  their occurrence is unavailable or limited. In the absence of
                  quality data, generalized biogeographic patterns could provide
                  the earliest (and in some cases the only) insights into the

                  health professionals (and vice versa) has the potential to
                  improve our understanding of infectious disease systems and
                  identify novel management strategies to improve local, global

                  research has provided conflicting results on the extent and
                  even direction of global biodiversity change at the local
                  scale. Here, we assessed the ability to detect global
                  biodiversity trends using local species richness and how it is
                  affected by the number of monitoring sites, sampling interval
                  (i.e. time between original survey and re‐survey of the site),
                  measurement error (error of the measurement of the local
                  species richness), spatial grain of monitoring (a proxy for
                  the taxa mobility) and spatial sampling biases (i.e.
                  site‐selection biases). We use PREDICTS model‐based estimates
                  as a proxy for the real‐world distribution of biodiversity and
                  randomly selected monitoring sites to calculate local species
                  richness trends. We found that while a monitoring network with
                  hundreds of sites could detect global change in species
                  richness within a 30‐year period, the number of sites for
                  detecting trends doubled for a decade, increased 10‐fold
                  within three years and yearly trends were undetectable.
                  Measurement errors had a non‐linear effect on statistical
                  power, with a 1\% error reducing statistical power by a slight
                  margin and a 5\% error drastically reducing the power to
                  reliably detect any trend. The ability to detect global change
                  in local species richness was also related to spatial grain,
                  making it harder to detect trends for sites sampled at smaller
                  plot sizes. Spatial sampling biases not only reduced the
                  ability to detect negative global biodiversity trends but
                  sometimes yielded positive trends. We conclude that detecting
                  accurate global biodiversity trends using local richness may
                  simply be unfeasible with current approaches. We suggest that
                  monitoring a representative network of sites implemented at
                  the national level, combined with models accounting for errors
                  and biases, can help improve our understanding of global

                  bat‐borne pathogens by affecting the ecology of bats in
                  tropical ecosystems. Here, we report the impacts of climate
                  change on the distributional ecology of the common vampire bat
                  Desmodus rotundus across the last century. Our retrospective
                  analysis revealed a positive relationship between changes in
                  climate and the northern expansion of the distribution of D.
                  rotundus in North America. Furthermore, we also found a
                  reduction in the standard deviation of temperatures at D.
                  rotundus capture locations during the last century, expressed
                  as more consistent, less‐seasonal climate in recent years.
                  These results elucidate an association between D. rotundus
                  range expansion and a continental‐level rise in rabies virus
                  spillover transmission from D. rotundus to cattle in the last
                  50 years of the 120‐year study period. This correlative study,
                  based on field observations, offers empirical evidence
                  supporting previous statistical and mathematical
                  simulation‐based studies reporting a likely increase of
                  bat‐borne diseases in response to climate change. We conclude
                  that the D. rotundus rabies system exemplifies the
                  consequences of climate change augmentation at the
                  wildlife–livestock–human interface, demonstrating how global
                  change acts upon these complex and interconnected systems to
                  drive increased disease emergence.},

  abstract     = {Whereas the latitudinal diversity gradient has been shown for
                  a diverse set of taxa, a related macroecological pattern, the
                  latitudinal specialization gradient (LSG), remains
                  controversial. A classical expectation is that species should
                  present more specialized interactions towards the equator,
                  however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence for
                  this hypothesis. Here, we tested the LSG in a set of
                  bird–malarial parasite networks across South America. Our
                  analyses comprise 9763 individual birds surveyed in 52
                  communities, within eight biomes and spanning a gradient of
                  4700 km. We measured network‐level specialization through
                  indices that account for increasingly comprehensive
                  information. Binary specialization considers the
                  occurrence/absence of interactions between each host–parasite
                  pair; quantitative specialization is also affected by the
                  frequency of interactions between each host–parasite pair; and
                  phylogenetic specialization takes into account the phylogeny
                  and abundances of host species. We found that, while binary
                  specialization increases towards the equator, quantitative
                  specialization decreases. Thus, despite each parasite lineage
                  infecting a more restricted set from the available host
                  species in low latitudes, infections were more evenly
                  distributed among host species, than in higher latitudes.
                  Additionally, using a structural equation model, we show that
                  both direct and indirect effects contribute to this unexpected
                  relationship. Direct effects are weak, and
                  network‐specialization was mostly explained by host species
                  and parasite lineage richness, evidencing that changes in
                  network specialization along latitude are in a large part
                  explained by the latitudinal diversity gradient for birds and
                  malarial‐parasites. In the light of the accumulated evidence
                  over the past years, reinforced by our findings, we suggest
                  that the classical latitudinal specialization hypothesis
                  should be reevaluated, making room for a theoretical framework
                  able to encompass the conflicting results.},

                  Although the field has progressed rapidly regarding theory and

                  hosts harbor the majority of symbionts. This ubiquitous
                  pattern can result from stochastic processes, but aggregation
                  patterns may also depend on the type of host–symbiont
                  interaction, along with traits that affect host exposure and
                  susceptibility to symbionts. Untangling how aggregation
                  patterns both within and among populations depend on
                  stochastic processes, interaction type and host traits remains
                  an outstanding challenge. Here, we address this challenge by
                  using null models to compare aggregation patterns in a neutral
                  system of Balanomorpha barnacles attached to patellid limpets
                  and a host–parasite system of Gyrodactylus spp. monogeneans
                  and their Trinidadian guppy Poecilia reticulata hosts. We
                  first used a model to predict patterns of symbiont–host
                  aggregation due to random partitioning of symbionts to hosts.
                  This null model accurately predicted the aggregation of
                  barnacles on limpets, but the degree of aggregation varied
                  across 303 quadrats. Quadrats with larger limpets had less
                  aggregated barnacles, whereas aggregation increased with
                  variation in limpet size. Across 84 guppy populations,
                  Gyrodactylus spp. parasites were significantly less aggregated
                  than predicted by the null model. As in the neutral
                  limpet–barnacle system, aggregation decreased with mean host
                  size. Parasites were significantly less aggregated on males
                  than females because male guppies tended to have higher
                  prevalence and lower parasite burdens than predicted by the
                  null model. Together, these results suggest stochastic
                  processes can explain aggregation patterns in neutral but not
                  parasitic systems, though in both systems host traits affect
                  aggregation patterns. Because the distribution of symbionts on
                  hosts can affect symbiont evolution via intraspecific
                  interactions, and host behavior and evolution via
                  host–symbiont interactions, identifying the drivers of
                  aggregation enriches our understanding of host–symbiont
                  interactions.},

                  cross‐species disease transmission, which incurs economic
                  costs and threatens wildlife conservation. Wild waterfowl are
                  natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), are often
                  abundant near poultry farms, and have been linked to outbreaks
                  of AIVs in poultry. Interspecific and seasonal variation in
                  waterfowl movement and habitat use means that the risk of
                  disease transmission between wild birds and poultry inevitably
                  varies across species, space, and time. Here, we used GPS
                  telemetry data from 10 waterfowl species in and near
                  California's Central Valley, a region where both wild
                  waterfowl and domestic poultry are abundant, to study
                  selection of poultry farms by waterfowl across diel, seasonal,
                  and annual cycles. We found that waterfowl selected for
                  wetlands, open water, protected areas, and croplands, which
                  meant that they generally avoided habitats that were likely to
                  be used for poultry farming. These selection patterns were
                  linked to species' ecology and diel behavioral patterns, such
                  that avoidance of poultry habitats was stronger for local or
                  partial migrants than for long‐distance migrants, and stronger
                  during daytime than at night. We then combined these habitat
                  selection results with data on poultry farm locations to map
                  risk of waterfowl–poultry contact across the Central Valley.
                  Average selection strength at poultry farms was low,
                  suggesting that current placement of poultry farms is
                  generally effective for limiting risk of contact with wild
                  birds. When we combined these habitat selection results with
                  data on species' abundances and AIV infection prevalence, we
                  found dramatic variation in potential AIV transmission risk
                  among species. These results could be used to prioritize
                  surveillance and biosecurity efforts for regions and times of

                  virus that poses a significant public health concern.
                  Mosquitoes transmit the virus in an enzootic cycle among
                  birds, which act as reservoirs. Climate plays a crucial role
                  in these outbreaks as mosquitoes are highly influenced by
                  climatic conditions, and bird migrations are also affected by
                  weather patterns. Consequently, changes in climate can
                  potentially impact the occurrence of WNV outbreaks. We used
                  biogeographic modelling based on machine learning algorithms
                  and fuzzy logic to analyse and evaluate separately the risk of
                  WNV outbreaks in two different biogeographic regions, the
                  Afrotropical and the Western Palaearctic region. By employing
                  fuzzy logic tools, we constructed a comprehensive risk model
                  that integrates the Afro‐Palaearctic system as a unified
                  operational unit for WNV spread. This innovative approach
                  recognizes the Afro‐Palaearctic region as a pathogeographic
                  system, characterized by biannual connections facilitated by
                  billions of migratory bird reservoirs carrying the disease.
                  Subsequently, we forecasted the effects of different climate
                  change scenarios on the spread of WNV in the Afro‐Palaearctic
                  system for the years 2040 and 2070. Our findings revealed an
                  increasing epidemic and epizootic risk south of the Sahara.
                  However, the area where an upsurge in risk was forecasted the
                  most lies within Europe, with the anticipation of risk
                  expansion into regions presently situated beyond the virus'
                  distribution range, including central and northern Europe.
                  Gaining insight into the risk within the Afro‐Palaearctic
                  system is crucial for establishing coordinated and

                  species, with many African mammals potentially serving either
                  as primary reservoirs or secondary amplifying hosts. Previous
                  work has shown that frugivorous bats and primates are often
                  associated with spillover and outbreaks. Yet the role that
                  patterns of biodiversity, either of mammalian hosts or of
                  common fruiting species such as Ficus (figs, fruit resources

                  compare a wide array of potential models (path diagrams) of
                  spatial dynamics. We considered mammalian frugivore richness,
                  cercopithecid and hominid primate richness, richness of
                  pteropodid (fruit) bats, the spatial distribution of species
                  that have tested positive for Ebolavirus antibodies in the
                  wild, Ficus habitat suitability, and environmental conditions
                  (mean annual and variability in temperature and rainfall). The
                  proximate factors that most influenced whether a given host
                  species range contained a site of a previous outbreak event
                  were 1) habitat suitability for Ficus and 2) the diversity of
                  cercopithecid primates. Frugivore richness overall (including
                  bats, primates, and a few other mammals) and the richness of
                  bats in the family Pteropodidae had a strong effect on which
                  species tested positive for Ebolavirus antibodies, but did not
                  influence outbreak risk directly in pathways explored. We
                  interpret this as evidence that foraging around Ficus and
                  frugivorous mammals (such as cercopithecid primates which are
                  commonly hunted for food) play a prominent role in driving

  abstract     = {Animal behaviour is important for prevalence and outbreaks of
                  infectious diseases, for instance by affecting individual
                  interactions. Increasing the knowledge of individual movement
                  patterns can provide better insight into disease prevalence
                  and spread, helping to target efforts to minimise disease
                  outbreaks. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion
                  disease affecting cervids. CWD is transmitted by
                  animal‐to‐animal contact and through the environment, thus
                  individual variation in space use and social associations may
                  influence disease transmission patterns and infection risk.
                  CWD was detected in Norwegian alpine reindeer Rangifer
                  tarandus tarandus in 2016, and eradication of the infected
                  population was implemented. A 3:1 infection rate between males
                  and females suggests sex‐specific behavioural drivers. We
                  utilised an extensive individual‐based dataset of 149
                  GPS‐marked wild reindeer to investigate individual variation
                  in movement patterns in terms of inter‐ and intra‐annual home
                  range size and site fidelity, and variation in home range
                  overlap and distances between individuals. We aimed to
                  identify patterns which could indicate higher potential
                  disease risk. Females had larger annual and seasonal home
                  ranges than males, except during calving and rut. Greater home
                  range overlaps and shorter between‐individual distances were
                  found between same‐sex individuals than different‐sex
                  individuals, except during the rut. Accordingly, the rut
                  season stands out with greater male home ranges, greater home
                  range overlap and shorter distances between males and between
                  males and females, which could indicate that this season is
                  critical for disease transmission. Measures to prevent disease
                  spread should lower contact rates, e.g. by reducing the
                  abundance of adult males before they mix with other groups
                  during the rut. This can be achieved for instance by allowing
                  earlier hunt on adult males when they are distributed in small
                  male groups, to reduce the transmission risk and keep
                  disturbance of other individuals low.},

                  forests are simultaneously attacked by multiple pathogens.
                  Usually, the impacts of each pathogen are studied separately,
                  however, interactions between them can affect disease
                  dynamics. Pathogens can interact directly by competing for the
                  same niche, but also facilitate or suppress each other via
                  indirect effects through the host. We studied 66 native
                  Mediterranean Pinus nigra stands located in the Pyrenees which
                  were affected by two pathogens with different structural
                  specificity: Dothistroma pini causing Dothistroma needle
                  blight and Diplodia sapinea causing Diplodia shoot blight. We
                  explored the ecology of both pathogens and whether the
                  diseases they caused had an impact on trees and recruits. No
                  signs of competition were found on adult trees. Diplodia shoot
                  blight was restricted to the warmest and driest areas, while
                  no climatic restrictions were identified for Dothistroma
                  needle blight. Both diseases caused additive effects on crown
                  defoliation and defoliated trees showed stagnated growth. In
                  the regeneration layer, signs of disease suppression were
                  found. In the warmest and driest areas, seedling mortality was
                  mainly associated with Diplodia shoot blight, even though both
                  pathogens were detected. Clear signs of D. pini spillover from
                  canopy trees to recruits were found. However, seedling
                  mortality caused by Dothistroma needle blight was only
                  restricted to the coldest and wettest sites where D. sapinea
                  could not survive. Large crowns in adult trees probably allow
                  both pathogens to co‐exist and cause additive impacts. The
                  smaller size of recruits and a higher susceptibility to
                  environmental stress compared to adult trees probably
                  facilitates the effects of Diplodia shoot blight which masked
                  those caused by Dothistroma needle blight. By considering
                  climatic constraints, host ontogeny and structural
                  specificity, we could dissect the disease impacts of two
                  different pathogens and successfully explain forest health at

                  ecosystem service they provide. The factors driving this
                  change are manifold, but land use changes and interspecific
                  transmission of pathogens between managed and wild bees are
                  prominent. In this context, most research efforts have focused
                  on specific taxa and rarely at the community level, limiting
                  our ability to fully understand the effects of global change
                  on the functioning of plant–pollinator interactions in
                  ecosystems.Here, we investigate the impact of human activities
                  (beekeeping and land use intensity) on the spread of an
                  emergent pathogen Vairimorpha ceranae in Mediterranean wild
                  bee communities inhabiting landscapes with varying levels of
                  anthropogenic disturbance. Plant–pollinator interactions were
                  sampled in nine one‐hectare plots along a gradient of land use
                  (urban structures, croplands and natural vegetation) and
                  beekeeping intensity. We analysed the impact of human
                  disturbances on pollination networks and pathogen prevalence,
                  and applied a network approach to examine whether total
                  effects of species in networks (i.e. direct plus indirect
                  interactions) explain pathogen spread through bee
                  communities.We found that V. ceranae prevalence in honey bees
                  is not a good predictor of the pathogen spread through bee
                  communities. There seems to be a temporal mismatch between
                  pathogen dynamics in managed and wild bees. Networks with more
                  diversity of interactions and more plants showed less pathogen
                  prevalence, but total effect analyses (i.e. combining direct
                  and indirect interactions) failed to explain pathogen
                  transmission across pollination networks. Croplands increased
                  wild bee density, and interactions and species diversity in
                  networks, while shrublands had the opposite effect. Our

                  illustrate this by investigating the Hantavirus–rodent system
                  in the Americas, i.e. New World Hantaviruses (NWH). First, we
                  considered the circulation of pathogenic NWH among Cricetidae
                  rodents, by inferring the phylogenetic links among 277 genomic
                  samples of the S segment (N protein) of NWH found in 55
                  species. Second, we used machine learning to assess the impact
                  of land use on the probability of presence of the rodent
                  species linked with reservoirs of pathogenic Hantaviruses. Our
                  results show that hosts are widely present across the

                  agricultural land, but not in the secondary forest, whereas
                  other hosts are present in secondary forest and agricultural
                  land. The diversity of host species allows Hantavirus to
                  circulate in a wide spectrum of habitats, in particular rural
                  rather than urban. We highlight that public repositories of
                  genomic data and species occurrence are very useful resources

                  epidemiology of a plant disease and in the microevolution of
                  its causative pathogen. In California and southern Oregon
                  (USA), the introduction of the invasive pathogen Phytophthora
                  ramorum, causal agent of the widespread disease Sudden Oak
                  Death (SOD), has resulted in extensive mortality of various
                  oaks Quercus sp. and of tanoak Notholithocarpus densiflorus.
                  Although the disease can infect over a hundred hosts,
                  California bay laurel Umbellularia californica is the most
                  competent transmissive host but is not lethally affected by
                  the disease. Using population genetics data, we identify the
                  relationship among P. ramorum populations in bay laurels, oaks
                  and tanoaks to clarify the contribution of each host on the

                  agent and to explore differences in population structure
                  across sites and years. We conclude that bay laurel is the
                  primary source for infections of both tanoak and oak, and that
                  tanoak contributes minimally to oak infection but can infect
                  bay laurel, creating a secondary pathogen amplification
                  process. Overall, pathogen diversity is associated with
                  rainfall and presence of bay laurels, which sustain the
                  largest populations of the pathogen. Additionally, we clarify
                  that while bay laurels are a common source of inoculum, oaks
                  and tanoaks act as sinks that maintain host‐specific pathogen
                  genotypes not observed in bay laurel populations. Finally, we
                  conclude that different sites support a dominance of different
                  pathogen genotypes. Some genotypes were widespread, while
                  others were limited to a subset of the plots. Sites with
                  higher bay laurel densities sustained a higher genotypic
                  diversity of the pathogen. This work provides novel insight

                  group to consider these effects, because they harbour many

                  context‐dependent responses to degradation that could affect

                  studies, which often differ in the bats or viruses sampled,
                  the study region, and methodology. To develop a broad
                  understanding of the associations between bat viruses and
                  habitat degradation, we conducted an initial phylogenetic
                  meta‐analysis that combines published prevalence and
                  seroprevalence (‘(sero)prevalence') with remote‐sensing
                  habitat degradation data. Our dataset includes 588 unique
                  records of (sero)prevalence across 16 studies, 64 bat species,
                  and five virus families. We quantified the overall strength
                  and direction of the relationship between habitat degradation
                  and bat virus outcomes and tested how this relationship is
                  moderated by the time between habitat degradation and bat
                  sampling and by ecological traits of bat hosts while
                  controlling for phylogenetic non‐independence among bat
                  species. We found no effect of degradation on prevalence
                  overall, although a weak effect may exist when forest loss
                  occurs the year prior to bat sampling. In contrast, we
                  detected a negative but weak association between degradation
                  and seroprevalence overall that was strengthened when forest
                  loss occurred the year prior to bat sampling. No bat traits
                  that we investigated interacted with habitat degradation to
                  impact virus outcomes, suggesting observed trends are
                  independent of these traits. Biases in our initial dataset
                  highlight opportunities for future work; prevalence was highly
                  zero‐inflated, and seroprevalence was dominated by Desmodus
                  rotundus and rabies virus. These findings and subsequent

                  strength of the correlation between species abundance and
                  genetic diversity should be related to community age in closed
                  communities (i.e. abundant species accumulate more genetic
                  diversity over time than rare species). Following this
                  rationale, we hypothesize that historical climatic events are
                  expected to impact assembly processes, hence affecting both
                  the species abundance distribution (SAD) and the species
                  genetic distribution (SGD) in continental communities.
                  Therefore, we predict that, if the congruence between SADs and

                  since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We tested this
                  prediction using relative abundance and nucleotide diversity
                  (cox1‐5′) data from 20 communities of leaf beetles along a
                  latitudinal transect in the Iberian Peninsula. We observed
                  that the congruence between SAD and SGD curves, measured as
                  the correlation between the species' rank orders in both
                  distributions, was significantly related to the change in mean
                  annual temperature since the LGM, but not to current climatic
                  conditions. Our results suggest that, despite the high
                  connectivity of continental communities, historical climatic
                  stability is still a relevant predictor of the congruence
                  between species abundance and genetic diversity. Hence, the
                  degree of congruence between SADs and SGDs could be used as a
                  proxy of community stability, related not only to historical
                  climatic variation but also to any other disrupting factors,
                  including human pressure.},

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are
                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful
                  measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity
                  can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic
                  levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of

                  complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and
                  apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to

                  From hunter-gatherers through to Neolithic societies-and
                  particularly in contemporary industrialised countries-humans
                  have (voluntarily or involuntarily) provided other animals
                  with food, often with a high spatio-temporal predictability.
                  Nowadays, as much as 30-40\% of all food produced in Earth is
                  wasted. We argue here that predictable anthropogenic food
                  subsidies (PAFS) provided historically by humans to animals
                  has shaped many communities and ecosystems as we see them
                  nowadays. PAFS improve individual fitness triggering
                  population increases of opportunistic species, which may
                  affect communities, food webs and ecosystems by altering
                  processes such as competition, predator-prey interactions and
                  nutrient transfer between biotopes and ecosystems. We also
                  show that PAFS decrease temporal population variability,
                  increase resilience of opportunistic species and reduce
                  community diversity. Recent environmental policies, such as
                  the regulation of dumps or the ban of fishing discards,
                  constitute natural experiments that should improve our

                  encapsulate the overall 'stability' of the system. Many
                  international bodies, including the Intergovernmental
                  Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
                  Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological
                  stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to
                  stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot

                  result from this modified focus? Although biodiversity
                  contributes to ecosystem services, the details of which
                  species are critical, and whether they will go functionally
                  extinct in the future, are fraught with uncertainty.
                  Explicitly considering this uncertainty, we develop an
                  analytical framework to determine how much biodiversity
                  protection would arise solely from optimising net value from
                  an ecosystem service. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we
                  find that protecting a threshold number of species is optimal,
                  and uncertainty surrounding how biodiversity produces services
                  makes it optimal to protect more species than are presumed

                  optimal protection strategy is to protect all species, no

                  when managing for particular ecosystem services could warrant
                  protecting all species, given uncertainty. Evaluating this
                  criterion with empirical estimates from different ecosystems

                  over transmission of pathogens from humans to animals, and its
                  potential to threaten conservation and public health. To
                  assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of
                  human‐to‐wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how
                  such events could threaten animal and human health. We
                  identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of
                  pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non‐human
                  primates or large, long‐lived captive animals. Relatively few
                  documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and
                  very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new
                  reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into
                  humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding
                  these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias
                  towards non‐human primates and human‐proximate mammals and the
                  possibility of systematic bias against reporting human
                  parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to
                  assess the risk of human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission. We
                  outline how researchers can collect experimental and
                  observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk
                  assessment for human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission.},

                  the maintenance of individual differences in behavior and
                  physiology is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The
                  pace‐of‐life syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain
                  the maintenance of such within‐population variation. This
                  hypothesis predicts that behavioral traits are part of a suite
                  of correlated traits that collectively determine an
                  individual's propensity to prioritize reproduction or
                  survival. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that these
                  traits are underpinned by genetic trade‐offs among
                  life‐history traits: genetic variants that increase fertility,
                  reproduction and growth might also reduce lifespan. We
                  performed a systematic literature review and meta‐analysis to
                  summarize the evidence for the existence of genetic trade‐offs
                  between five key life‐history traits: survival, growth rate,
                  body size, maturation rate, and fertility. Counter to our
                  predictions, we found an overall positive genetic correlation
                  between survival and other life‐history traits and no evidence
                  for any genetic correlations between the non‐survival
                  life‐history traits. This finding was generally consistent
                  across pairs of life‐history traits, sexes, life stages, lab
                  vs. field studies, and narrow‐ vs. broad‐sense correlation
                  estimates. Our study highlights that genetic trade‐offs may
                  not be as common, or at least not as easily quantifiable, in
                  animals as often assumed.},

                  biologists for nearly two centuries and are increasingly
                  important in our era of global climate change. These
                  relationships are hypothesized to originate from the
                  temperature‐dependent kinetics of rate‐limiting biochemical
                  reactions of metabolism. Several prominent theories have
                  formalized this hypothesis using the Arrhenius model, which
                  characterizes a monotonic temperature dependence using an
                  activation energy E. However, the ubiquitous unimodal nature
                  of biological temperature responses presents important
                  theoretical, methodological, and conceptual challenges that
                  restrict the promise for insight, prediction, and progress.
                  Here we review the development of key hypotheses and methods
                  for the temperature‐scaling of biological rates. Using
                  simulations, we examine the constraints of monotonic models,
                  illustrating their sensitivity to data nuances such as
                  temperature range and noise, and their tendency to yield
                  variable and underestimated E, with critical consequences for
                  climate change predictions. We also evaluate the behaviour of
                  two prominent unimodal models when applied to incomplete and
                  noisy datasets. We conclude with recommendations for resolving
                  these challenges in future research, and advocate for a shift
                  to unimodal models that better characterize the full range of

                  Early career researchers (ECRs) are particularly vulnerable to

                  plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and

                  26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be

                  but how urban growth affects the evolutionary ecology of
                  species living in urban areas remains largely unknown. Urban
                  ecology has advanced our understanding of how the development
                  of cities and towns change environmental conditions and alter
                  ecological processes and patterns. However, despite decades of
                  research in urban ecology, the extent to which urbanization
                  influences evolutionary and eco-evolutionary change has
                  received little attention. The nascent field of urban
                  evolutionary ecology seeks to understand how urbanization
                  affects the evolution of populations, and how those
                  evolutionary changes in turn influence the ecological dynamics
                  of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Following a brief
                  history of this emerging field, this Perspective article
                  provides a research agenda and roadmap for future research
                  aimed at advancing our understanding of the interplay between
                  ecology and evolution of urban-dwelling organisms. We identify
                  six key questions that, if addressed, would significantly
                  increase our understanding of how urbanization influences
                  evolutionary processes. These questions consider how
                  urbanization affects nonadaptive evolution, natural selection,
                  and convergent evolution, in addition to the role of urban
                  environmental heterogeneity on species evolution, and the
                  roles of phenotypic plasticity versus adaptation on species'
                  abundance in cities. Our final question examines the impact of
                  urbanization on evolutionary diversification. For each of
                  these six questions, we suggest avenues for future research
                  that will help advance the field of urban evolutionary
                  ecology. Lastly, we highlight the importance of integrating
                  urban evolutionary ecology into urban planning, conservation

                  locations, local adaptation modifies the gene frequencies so
                  their carriers are better suited to particular conditions, be
                  those of newly disturbed soil or a quiet river pool. Both
                  dispersal and local adaptation are major drivers of population
                  structure; however, in general, their respective roles are not
                  independent and the two may often be at odds with one another
                  evolutionarily, each one exhibiting negative feedback on the
                  evolution of the other. Here, we investigate their joint
                  evolution within a simple, discrete-time, metapopulation
                  model. Depending on environmental conditions, their
                  evolutionary interplay leads to either a monomorphic

                  two selection regimes and the nature of the transition between

                  competition is low, at the transition we observe
                  discontinuities, bistability, and hysteresis in the evolved
                  strategies; however, when high, kin competition moderates the
                  evolutionary feedback and the transition is smooth.},

                  the potential for local adaptation to spatially differentiated
                  resource types. We lack both models and experiments that
                  evaluate how dispersal evolves in landscapes with multiple
                  resources. Here, we investigate the evolution of dispersal in
                  landscapes that contain two resource types that differ in
                  their spatial autocorrelations. Individuals may possess
                  ecological traits that give them a fitness advantage on one or

                  can support the stable coexistence of distinct dispersal
                  strategies. Whether divergence in dispersal strategies between

                  important factor in determining when evolutionary branching is
                  likely to occur, and sheds light on when secondary isolating

                  within a community, differential coevolution among
                  communities, lineage divergence, and phylogenetic patterns. We

                  wildlife reservoirs of plague (Yersinia pestis) now persist
                  around the world, including in the western United States.
                  Routine surveillance in this region has generated
                  comprehensive records of human cases and animal
                  seroprevalence, creating a unique opportunity to test how
                  plague reservoirs are responding to environmental change.
                  Here, we test whether animal and human data suggest that
                  plague reservoirs and spillover risk have shifted since 1950.
                  To do so, we develop a new method for detecting the impact of
                  climate change on infectious disease distributions, capable of
                  disentangling long-term trends (signal) and interannual
                  variation in both weather and sampling (noise). We find that
                  plague foci are associated with high-elevation rodent
                  communities, and soil biochemistry may play a key role in the
                  geography of long-term persistence. In addition, we find that
                  human cases are concentrated only in a small subset of endemic
                  areas, and that spillover events are driven by higher rodent
                  species richness (the amplification hypothesis) and climatic
                  anomalies (the trophic cascade hypothesis). Using our
                  detection model, we find that due to the changing climate,
                  rodent communities at high elevations have become more
                  conducive to the establishment of plague reservoirs-with
                  suitability increasing up to 40\% in some places-and that
                  spillover risk to humans at mid-elevations has increased as
                  well, although more gradually. These results highlight
                  opportunities for deeper investigation of plague ecology, the
                  value of integrative surveillance for infectious disease
                  geography, and the need for further research into ongoing

                  for specific leaf area (SLA) available within the largest and
                  most frequently used global plant trait database, the TRY
                  Plant Trait Database, exploring how much of the data were
                  applicable (i.e., original, representative, logical, and
                  comparable) and traceable (i.e., published, cited, and
                  consistent). Over three‐quarters of the SLA data in TRY either
                  lacked applicability or traceability, leaving only 22.9\% of
                  the original data usable compared with the 64.9\% typically
                  deemed usable by standard data cleaning protocols. The
                  remaining usable data differed markedly from the original for
                  many species, which led to altered interpretation of

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response
                  to different climate variables than do individual
                  species.LocationEurasia.Time period2000s.Major
                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to
                  β‐diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51
                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some
                  climatic variables that have no effect on species

                  south‐eastern Pyrenees and Europe) and evaluate how well these
                  models predict pairwise interactions and network properties of

                  Performance was best for training and testing on the same food
                  web (AUC > 0.90) and declined with environmental and
                  phylogenetic distances with the strongest loss of performance
                  for the tundra‐Serengeti ecosystems (AUC > 0.75). Network
                  metrics were less well‐predicted than single interactions by
                  our models with predicted food webs being more connected, less
                  modular, and with higher mean trophic levels than
                  observed.Main ConclusionsTheory predicts that the variability
                  observed in food webs can be explained by differences in trait
                  distributions and trait‐matching relationships. Our finding
                  that trait‐based models can predict many trophic interactions,
                  even in contrasting environments, adds to the growing body of
                  evidence that there are general constraints on interactions
                  and that trait‐based methods can serve as a useful first
                  approximation of food webs in unknown areas. However, food
                  webs are more than the sum of their parts, and predicting
                  network attributes will likely require models that
                  simultaneously predict individual interactions and community
                  constraints.},

                  cultural evolution can be made irrespective of whether unitary

                  energetic reserves allowed either investment in gonads and
                  spleen, or that spleen investment, even if often used in other
                  studies in immunoecology, was not always a significant
                  indicator of immunocompetence during this period. This last

                  spleen investment and other factors linked to
                  immunocompetence.},

  abstract     = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and
                  prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
                  express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
                  and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
                  boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
                  statistical models that differs fundamentally from
                  conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious
                  model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two
                  algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to
                  their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an
                  adaptive method for combining many simple models to give
                  improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be
                  understood as an additive regression model in which individual
                  terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise
                  fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important
                  advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of
                  predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have
                  no need for prior data transformation or elimination of
                  outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and
                  automatically handle interaction effects between predictors.
                  Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback
                  of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive
                  performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be
                  summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and
                  their predictive performance is superior to most traditional
                  modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a
                  number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate
                  the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a
                  distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla
                  australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
                  Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
                  effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a
                  model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a
                  tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

  abstract     = {1. The strength of the trophic link between any given pair of
                  species in a food web is likely to depend on the presence
                  and/or densities of other species in the community. How these
                  trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one
                  another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but
                  under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of
                  TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude
                  of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers,
                  and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each
                  other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are
                  generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact
                  antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of
                  TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce
                  the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4.
                  Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect
                  in many-species systems than expected from independent
                  combination of modifications measured in systems with
                  relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs
                  may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level
                  perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are
                  implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many
                  types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a
                  complete understanding of their effects may require theory
                  that distinguishes different 'functional groups' of modifiers
                  and addresses how these are structured according to trophic
                  relationships.},

                  on locations where the species is absent, are common in both
                  animal and plant studies. In many situations, these may be the
                  only data available on a species. We need effective ways to
                  use these data to explore species distribution or species use
                  of habitat.Many analytical approaches have been used to model
                  presence‐only data, some inappropriately. We provide a
                  synthesis and critique of statistical methods currently in use
                  to both estimate and evaluate these models, and discuss the
                  critical importance of study design in models where only
                  presence can be identifiedProfile or envelope methods exist to
                  characterize environmental covariates that describe the
                  locations where organisms are found. Predictions from profile
                  approaches are generally coarse, but may be useful when
                  species records, environmental predictors and biological
                  understanding are scarce.Alternatively, one can build models
                  to contrast environmental attributes associated with known
                  locations with a sample of random landscape locations, termed
                  either ‘pseudo‐absences’ or ‘available’. Great care needs to
                  be taken when selecting random landscape locations, because
                  the way in which they are selected determines the modelling
                  techniques that can be applied.Regression‐based models can
                  provide predictions of the relative likelihood of occurrence,
                  and in some situations predictions of the probability of
                  occurrence. The logistic model is frequently applied, but can
                  rarely be used directly to estimate these models; instead,
                  case–control or logistic discrimination should be used
                  depending on the sample design.Cross‐validation can be used to
                  evaluate model performance and to assess how effectively the
                  model reflects a quantity proportional to the probability of
                  occurrence. However, more research is needed to develop a
                  single measure or statistic that summarizes model performance
                  for presence‐only data.Synthesis and applications.A number of
                  statistical procedures are available to explore patterns in
                  presence‐only data; the choice among them depends on the
                  quality of the presence‐only data. Presence‐only records can
                  provide insight into the vulnerability, historical
                  distribution and conservation status of species. Models
                  developed using these data can inform management. Our caveat
                  is that researchers must be mindful of study design and the
                  biases inherent in presence data, and be cautious in the
                  interpretation of model predictions.},

                  concepts in ecology and conservation. However, this concept
                  has become highly context‐dependent and is now obscured by the
                  great variability of existing definitions and methods used to
                  characterize ecological specialization. 2. In this study, we
                  clarify this concept by reviewing the strengths and
                  limitations of different approaches commonly used to define
                  and measure ecological specialization. We first show that
                  ecological specialization can either be considered as
                  reflecting species’ requirements or species’ impacts. We then
                  explain how specialization depends on species‐specific
                  characteristics and on local and contingent environmental
                  constraints. We further show why and how ecological
                  specialization should be scaled across spatial and temporal
                  scales, and from individuals to communities. 3. We then
                  illustrate how this review can be used as a practical toolbox
                  to classify widely used metrics of ecological specialization
                  in applied ecology, depending on the question being addressed,
                  the method used, and the data available. 4. Synthesis and
                  applications. Clarifying ecological specialization is useful
                  to make explicit connections between several fields of ecology
                  using the niche concept. Defining this concept and its
                  practical metrics is also a crucial step to better formulate
                  predictions of scientific interest in ecology and
                  conservation. Finally, understanding the different facets of
                  ecological specialization should facilitate to investigate the
                  causes and consequences of biotic homogenization and to derive
                  relevant indicators of biodiversity responses to land‐use

                  synthesizes literature that focuses on phylogenetic analyses
                  and reciprocal mapping of a model system of hosts and their
                  parasites to determine patterns of host–parasite associations
                  and geographical distributions through time.Results
                  Host‐switching and geographical dispersal of parasites are
                  common phenomena, occurring on many temporal and spatial
                  scales. Diversification involving both co‐evolution and
                  colonization explains complex host–parasite associations.
                  Across the expanse of Earth history, the major radiations in
                  host–parasite assemblages have been preceded by ecological
                  disruption, ecological breakdown and host‐switching in a
                  context that can be defined by the concept of ecological
                  fitting. This cyclical process sets the stage for
                  co‐diversification during periods of relative stability,
                  punctuated by host‐switching during episodes of regional to
                  global environmental disruption and climatological change.Main
                  conclusions Most observed host–parasite associations can be
                  explained by an historical interaction between ecological
                  fitting, oscillation (episodes of increasing host range
                  alternating with isolation on particular hosts) and taxon
                  pulses (cyclical episodes of expansion and isolation in
                  geographical range). Major episodes of environmental change
                  appear to be the main drivers for both the persistence and
                  diversification of host–parasite systems, creating
                  opportunities for host‐switching during periods of
                  geographical expansion and allowing for co‐evolution and
                  co‐speciation during periods of geographical isolation.},

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security.
                  As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious
                  diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate
                  multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research
                  in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component,

                  species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis
                  on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community
                  contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to
                  quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose
                  a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental
                  niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data.Location
                  Europe, North America and South America.Methods The framework
                  applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in
                  gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche
                  overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We
                  use this framework and simulated species with pre‐defined
                  distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several
                  ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for
                  quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with
                  data on two well‐studied invasive species.Results We show that
                  niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework
                  when variables driving the distributions are known. The method
                  is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related
                  to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of
                  environmental conditions that occur across geographical space.
                  The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from
                  geographical space to multivariate environmental space
                  independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of
                  resolution in environmental space. However, the use of
                  ordination and species distribution model techniques for
                  selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche
                  overlap is calculated provide contrasting results.Main
                  conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust
                  methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for
                  studying niche differences between species, subspecies or
                  intra‐specific lineages that differ in their geographical
                  distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the
                  degree to which the environmental niche of a species or

                  the biological sciences. While there are reliable ways to
                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for
                  species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend
                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are
                  available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results
                  will assist both applied and fundamental researchers in the

                  and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an
                  ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different

                  under the curve scores computed by leave‐one‐out were used to
                  assess variable importance at the continental scale, while
                  local regression combined with recursive partition trees was
                  used to assess variable importance at the local

                  most important predictors at the continental scale, while
                  topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at
                  the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were

                  abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping
                  Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial. The
                  high suitability of the Mediterranean coastlines and the low
                  suitability values of most sites at the northern and eastern
                  distribution limits (Germany, Hungary, Ukraine) challenge the

                  over the last 30 years as a widely used tool used in core
                  areas of biogeography including historical biogeography,
                  studies of diversity patterns, studies of species ranges,
                  ecoregional classification, conservation assessment and
                  projecting future global change impacts. In the 50th
                  anniversary year of Journal of Biogeography, I reflect on
                  developments in species distribution modelling, illustrate how
                  embedded the methodology has become in all areas of
                  biogeography and speculate on future directions in the field.
                  Challenges to species distribution modelling raised in this
                  journal in 2006 have been addressed to a significant degree.
                  Those challenges are clarification of the niche concept;
                  improved sample design for species occurrence data; model
                  parameterization; predictor selection; assessing model
                  performance and transferability; and integrating correlative
                  and process models of species distributions. SDM is used,
                  often in conjunction with other evidence, to understand past
                  species range dynamics, identify patterns and drivers of

                  understudied area of predator–prey dynamics. Range overlap
                  with predators that induce the response and local demographics
                  (e.g., prey abundances) are likely to be important factors for
                  determining the biogeographic distribution of induced defences
                  within species. However, with climate warming, range‐expanding
                  warm‐water predators are increasingly preying upon temperate
                  species. This is a consequence of a wider phenomenon known as
                  tropicalisation. We aim to determine: (i) if individuals of a
                  temperate barnacle with induced defences (‘bent morphs’) are
                  primarily present where they co‐occur with range‐expanding
                  warm‐water predators (muricid snails) and, (ii) if bent morphs

                  rubescens and their association with populations with bent
                  morphs and abundance patterns of T. rubescens.ResultsBent
                  morphs are commonly found within the equatorward portion of
                  the species' range (where abundances are highest), in
                  populations overlapping with range‐expanding warm‐water
                  predators. Bent morphs primarily occur within the smaller size
                  classes.Main conclusionsTo be partly resilient to the effects
                  of tropicalisation, temperate prey must acclimatise/adapt to
                  altered predator–prey dynamics. Predator‐induced defences are
                  one way to do this. We show that bent morphs within a
                  temperate prey species (T. rubescens) are largely restricted
                  to populations that overlap with large‐bodied and
                  range‐expanding warm‐water predators. This is evidence for the
                  partial resilience of T. rubescens to tropicalisation and
                  provides the rationale for further exploration of the

                  Although some theories describe the imprint that interactions
                  will have over long timescales, we are still missing a
                  comprehensive understanding of the effects of interactions on

                  and behavioural thermoregulation) is one of the most important
                  mechanisms exhibited by organisms to respond to global
                  warming. However, the evolutionary potential of heat
                  tolerance, estimated as narrow-sense heritability, depends on
                  the methodology employed. An alternative adaptive mechanism to
                  buffer extreme temperatures is behavioural thermoregulation,
                  although the association between heat tolerance and thermal
                  preference is not clearly understood. We suspect that
                  methodological effects associated with the duration of heat
                  stress during thermal tolerance assays are responsible for
                  missing this genetic association. To test this hypothesis, we
                  estimated the heritabilities and genetic correlations for
                  thermal traits in Drosophila subobscura, using
                  high-temperature static and slow ramping assays. We found that
                  heritability for heat tolerance was higher in static assays
                  (h2 = 0.134) than in slow ramping assays (h2 = 0.084),
                  suggesting that fast assays may provide a more precise
                  estimation of the genetic variation of heat tolerance. In
                  addition, thermal preference exhibited a low heritability (h2
                  = 0.066), suggesting a reduced evolutionary response for this
                  trait. We also found that the different estimates of heat
                  tolerance and thermal preference were not genetically
                  correlated, regardless of how heat tolerance was estimated. In
                  conclusion, our data suggest that these thermal traits can
                  evolve independently in this species. In agreement with
                  previous evidence, these results indicate that methodology may
                  have an important impact on genetic estimates of heat
                  tolerance and that fast assays are more likely to detect the
                  genetic component of heat tolerance.},

                  biodiversity at risk. Organisms are faced with a limited set
                  of options to cope with this situation: adapt, disperse or
                  die. We here focus on the first possibility, more
                  specifically, on evolutionary adaptations to temperature.
                  Ectotherms are usually characterized by a hump-shaped
                  relationship between fitness and temperature, a non-linear
                  reaction norm that is referred to as thermal performance curve
                  (TPC). To understand and predict impacts of global change, we
                  need to know whether and how such TPCs evolve. Therefore, we
                  performed a systematic literature search and a statistical
                  meta-analysis focusing on experimental evolution and
                  artificial selection studies. This focus allows us to directly
                  quantify relative fitness responses to temperature selection
                  by calculating fitness differences between TPCs from ancestral
                  and derived populations after thermal selection. Out of 7561
                  publications screened, we found 47 studies corresponding to
                  our search criteria representing taxa across the tree of life,
                  from bacteria, to plants and vertebrates. We show that,
                  independently of species identity, the studies we found report
                  a positive response to temperature selection. Considering
                  entire TPC shapes, adaptation to higher temperatures traded
                  off with fitness at lower temperatures, leading to niche
                  shifts. Effects were generally stronger in unicellular
                  organisms. By contrast, we do not find statistical support for
                  the often discussed "Hotter is better" hypothesis. While our
                  meta-analysis provides evidence for adaptive potential of TPCs
                  across organisms, it also highlights that more experimental
                  work is needed, especially for under-represented taxa, such as
                  plants and non-model systems.},

                  hominid in North America. Previous analyses have identified a
                  correlation between ‘sasquatch’ or ‘bigfoot’ sightings and
                  black bear populations in the Pacific Northwest using
                  ecological niche models and simple models of expected animal
                  sightings. The present study expands the analysis to the
                  entire US and Canada by modelling sasquatch sightings and bear
                  populations in each state/province while adjusting for human
                  population and forest area in a generalized linear model.
                  Sasquatch sightings were statistically significantly
                  associated with bear populations such that, on the average,
                  every bear increase in the bear population is associated with
                  a ( CI: –) increase in sasquatch sightings. Thus, as black
                  bear populations increase, sasquatch sightings are expected to
                  increase. On average, across all states and provinces in 2006,
                  after controlling for human population and forest area, there
                  were approximately bears per sasquatch sighting. Based on
                  statistical considerations, it is likely that many supposed

                  the ability to recognize specific pathogen effectors is
                  elusive. Here, we cloned Pvr4 (a Potyvirus resistance gene in
                  Capsicum annuum) and Tsw (a Tomato spotted wilt virus
                  resistance gene in Capsicum chinense) via a genome-based
                  approach using independent segregating populations. The genes
                  both encode typical NLRs and are located at the same locus on

                  recognize completely different viral effectors, the genomic

                  ecosystems across Africa, Asia, and Australia. In each of
                  these regions, pteropodids have been identified as natural
                  reservoir hosts for henipaviruses. The genus Henipavirus
                  includes Hendra virus and Nipah virus, which regularly spill
                  over from bats to domestic animals and humans in Australia and
                  Asia, and a suite of largely uncharacterized African
                  henipaviruses. Rapid change in fruit bat habitat and
                  associated shifts in their ecology and behavior are well

                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets

                  This could trigger a cascade effect on the dynamics of
                  biological communities, but the role of parasites in ecosystem
                  processes is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate
                  how parasite‐induced trait modifications shape the dynamics of
                  a complex lake food web using an allometric trophic network
                  model (ATN). We simulated infections of stage‐structured fish
                  host populations via increased maintenance costs and predation
                  risk. Our results show that host trait modifications can
                  significantly impact host demography, with stage‐specific
                  biomass declines up to 60\%. However, less severely affected
                  host stages buffered these effects and sustained the
                  population. Importantly, host biomass decline altered the
                  dynamics of species interactions and these effects cascaded
                  through the entire community, with biomass changes observed at
                  all trophic levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of
                  incorporating both indirect parasite effects and host life

                  compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set
                  available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing
                  climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major
                  parasite clades. On the basis of 53,133 occurrences capturing
                  the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative
                  model projections suggest that 5 to 10\% of these species are
                  committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat
                  loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic

                  in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites

                  been culled for decades in hopes of mitigating lethal rabies
                  infections in humans and livestock. Whether culls reduce or
                  exacerbate rabies transmission remains controversial. Using
                  Bayesian state-space models, we show that a 2-year, spatially
                  extensive bat cull in an area of exceptional rabies incidence
                  in Peru failed to reduce spillover to livestock, despite

                  culling accelerated spread, suggesting that culling-induced

                  viruses that are highly pathogenic in other mammals. Here, we
                  have characterized the functional diversification of the
                  protein kinase R (PKR), a major antiviral innate defense
                  system. Our data indicate that PKR has evolved under positive
                  selection and has undergone repeated genomic duplications in
                  bats in contrast to all studied mammals that have a single
                  copy of the gene. Functional testing of the relationship
                  between PKR and poxvirus antagonists revealed how an
                  evolutionary conflict with ancient pathogenic poxviruses has
                  shaped a specific bat host-virus interface. We determined that
                  duplicated PKRs of the Myotis species have undergone genetic
                  diversification, allowing them to collectively escape from and
                  enhance the control of DNA and RNA viruses. These findings
                  suggest that viral-driven adaptations in PKR contribute to
                  modern virus-bat interactions and may account for bat-specific

                  Here, through a combination of phylogenetic and

                  transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons
                  in Brazil. A suitability index based on the highly
                  domesticated Aedes aegypti was able to capture the seasonality
                  of reported human infections. Spatial modeling revealed
                  spatial hotspots with both past reporting and low vaccination

                  increased for all boundaries earlier identified as

                  departments, we show that women leave academia overall at

                  fields, and career ages in which retention rates are not.

                  It remains unclear, however, how much a community's

                  overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using
                  data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles

  abstract     = {Climate change has the potential to affect the ecology and
                  evolution of every species on Earth. Although the ecological
                  consequences of climate change are increasingly well
                  documented, the effects of climate on the key evolutionary
                  process driving adaptation-natural selection-are largely
                  unknown. We report that aspects of precipitation and potential
                  evapotranspiration, along with the North Atlantic Oscillation,
                  predicted variation in selection across plant and animal
                  populations throughout many terrestrial biomes, whereas
                  temperature explained little variation. By showing that
                  selection was influenced by climate variation, our results
                  indicate that climate change may cause widespread alterations
                  in selection regimes, potentially shifting evolutionary
                  trajectories at a global scale.},

                  at low prevalence among domestic dogs in low- and
                  middle-income countries. We traced rabies transmission in a

                  applied individual-based models to these spatially resolved

                  the scale over which they operate. Although rabies prevalence

                  Negotiations underway now will determine whether they vote
                  then to adopt a pandemic agreement. For the past 2 years,
                  discussions have focused on articulating essential components
                  of a robust and equitable architecture for pandemic
                  preparedness and response. Despite this, talks have failed to
                  produce sufficient consensus on a detailed draft, prompting
                  the intergovernmental negotiating body to propose a
                  “streamlined” version. The new text, released on 16 April,
                  consolidates provisions for research and development,
                  technology transfer, pathogen access and benefit sharing
                  (including pandemic products such as medicines and vaccines),
                  with many particulars deferred to future procedures.
                  Ultimately, success of the agreement will depend on these
                  details and implementation. Nevertheless, member states
                  shouldn’t bypass the consensus reached to date, but continue

  abstract     = {Our current understanding of plant viruses stems largely from
                  those affecting economically important plants. Yet plant
                  species in cultivation represent a small and biased subset of
                  the plant kingdom. Here, we describe virus diversity and
                  abundance in 1,079 transcriptomes from species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) by analyzing
                  open-source data from the 1000 Plant Transcriptomes Initiative
                  (1KP). We identified 104 potentially novel viruses, of which
                  40\% were single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses across
                  eight orders, including members of the Hepelivirales,
                  Tymovirales, Cryppavirales, Martellivirales, and
                  Picornavirales. One-third of the newly described viruses were
                  double-stranded RNA viruses from the orders Durnavirales and
                  Ghabrivirales. The remaining were negative-sense RNA viruses
                  from the Rhabdoviridae, Aspiviridae, Yueviridae, and
                  Phenuiviridae and the newly proposed Viridisbunyaviridae. Our
                  analysis considerably expands the known host range of 13 virus
                  families to include lower plants (e.g., Benyviridae and
                  Secoviridae) and 4 virus families to include alga hosts (e.g.,
                  Tymoviridae and Chrysoviridae). More broadly, however, a
                  cophylogeny analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of
                  these families is largely driven by cross-species transmission
                  events. The discovery of the first 30-kDa movement protein in
                  a nonvascular plant suggests that the acquisition of plant
                  virus movement proteins occurred prior to the emergence of the
                  plant vascular system. Together, these data highlight that
                  numerous RNA virus families are associated with older
                  evolutionary plant lineages than previously thought and that
                  the apparent scarcity of RNA viruses found in lower plants
                  likely reflects a lack of investigation rather than their
                  absence. IMPORTANCE Our knowledge of plant viruses is mainly
                  limited to those infecting economically important host
                  species. In particular, we know little about those viruses
                  infecting basal plant lineages such as the ferns, lycophytes,
                  bryophytes, and charophytes. To expand this understanding, we
                  conducted a broad-scale viral survey of species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom. We found that basal plants
                  harbor a wide diversity of RNA viruses, including some that
                  are sufficiently divergent to likely compose a new virus
                  family. The basal plant virome revealed offers key insights
                  into the evolutionary history of core plant virus gene modules
                  and genome segments. More broadly, this work emphasizes that
                  the scarcity of viruses found in these species to date most
                  likely reflects the limited research in this area.},

                  field of microbial ecology has many current and potential uses
                  for machine learning (ML) modeling. With the increased use of
                  predictive ML models across many disciplines, including
                  microbial ecology, there is extensive published information on
                  the specific ML algorithms available and how those algorithms
                  have been applied. Thus, our goal is not to summarize the
                  breadth of ML models available or compare their performances.
                  Rather, our goal is to provide more concrete and actionable
                  information to guide microbial ecologists in how to select,
                  run, and interpret ML algorithms to predict the taxa or genes
                  associated with particular sample categories or environmental
                  gradients of interest. Such microbial data often have unique
                  characteristics that require careful consideration of how to
                  apply ML models and how to interpret the associated results.
                  This review is intended for practicing microbial ecologists
                  who may be unfamiliar with some of the intricacies of ML
                  models. We provide examples and discuss common opportunities
                  and pitfalls specific to applying ML models to the types of

                  degrees of open sharing, posing challenges for research on
                  macroecology, evolution, and public health. Here, we solve
                  this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database
                  of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in
                  One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled
                  through both reconciliation of static data sets and
                  integration of dynamically updated databases. These data
                  sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone,
                  including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and
                  higher classification; additional metadata on sampling
                  methodology and evidence strength are also available in a
                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an
                  unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global
                  virome.},

                  development today have their origins in racism and
                  colonialism, which has created a false hierarchy among
                  nations, ascribed a higher value to some lives, and allowed
                  some groups to extract, exploit and subjugate others.1–4 The
                  persistent echoes of these origins are seen everywhere,
                  particularly in the way we use terms that classify countries
                  and people: rich versus poor nations; resource-rich versus
                  resource-limited settings; First versus Third World; Old
                  versus New World; developed versus developing countries;
                  high-income countries (HICs) versus low/middle-income
                  countries (LMICs); global North versus global South;
                  beneficiaries versus donors; white versus Black Indigenous and
                  People of Color (BIPOC) and so on (see Table 1). The terms
                  ‘global’ or its much-used counterpart ‘international’ imply a
                  world outside rich nations (often seen as the epicentre of
                  everything progressive and ‘good’); a world which needs
                  development or health assistance. The fact that these implicit
                  connotations are largely unchallenged in most global health
                  and global development institutions in HICs itself is
                  worrisome and illustrates how both these sectors continue to
                  be steeped in white supremacy and saviorism.2 Even terms
                  originally coined without a connotation of hierarchy, such as
                  global North versus global South (or West vs East), end up
                  implying hierarchies given these divisions are based on access
                  to wealth and political power. The temptation to categorise
                  and dichotomise is very powerful and pervasive. All of us have
                  used some of these terms at some point in our professions and
                  activities. Some terms such as the now defunct ‘First World vs

                  that some are first and others behind.5 Most people today

                  has demonstrated that researchers from low-income and

                  there has been little attention paid to where research is

                heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.
                Understanding uncertainty is critical for many analytical tasks.
                One common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty
                values independently, using two visual variables. These
                resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and
                interference between visual channels can reduce the
                discriminability of marks. To address this issue, we contribute
                Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs). VSUPs allocate
                larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is
                low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. This
                non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more
                economical use of the limited visual encoding space when
                uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making
                when uncertainty is high. We demonstrate several examples of
                VSUPs, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that,
                compared to traditional bivariate maps, VSUPs encourage people
                to more heavily weight uncertainty information in

                  for writing succinct and rigorous descriptions of
                  probabilistic models and inference tasks. Several
                  probabilistic programming languages, including Anglican,
                  Church or Hakaru, derive their expressiveness from a powerful
                  combination of continuous distributions, conditioning, and
                  higher-order functions. Although very important for practical
                  applications, these features raise fundamental challenges for
                  program semantics and verification. Several recent works offer
                  promising answers to these challenges, but their primary focus
                  is on foundational semantics issues. In this paper, we take a
                  step further by developing a suite of logics, collectively
                  named PPV for proving properties of programs written in an
                  expressive probabilistic higher-order language with continuous
                  sampling operations and primitives for conditioning
                  distributions. Our logics mimic the comfortable reasoning
                  style of informal proofs using carefully selected
                  axiomatizations of key results from probability theory. The
                  versatility of our logics is illustrated through the formal
                  verification of several intricate examples from statistics,
                  probabilistic inference, and machine learning. We further show
                  expressiveness by giving sound embeddings of existing logics.
                  In particular, we do this in a parametric way by showing how
                  the semantics idea of (unary and relational) ⊤⊤-lifting can be
                  internalized in our logics. The soundness of PPV follows by
                  interpreting programs and assertions in quasi-Borel spaces
                  (QBS), a recently proposed variant of Borel spaces with a good
                  structure for interpreting higher order probabilistic

                  being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated
                  flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like
                  that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own
                  course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent

                  anthropological response and describes the protagonists,
                  interventions, and priorities for anthropological engagement.
                  It takes an inclusive approach to anthropological praxis by
                  engaging with the work of nonanthropologist “allies,”
                  including qualitative researchers, social workers, and allied
                  experts. The article narrates how the concept of
                  “anthropology” came to serve as a semantic marker of
                  solidarity with local populations, respect for customary
                  practices and local sociopolitical realities, and an avowed
                  belief in the capacities of local populations to lead
                  localized epidemic prevention and response efforts. Of

                  the rates of nutrient cycling, reconfiguring ecosystem-level
                  networks. Because large mammals have high mobility, their loss
                  also shortened seed-dispersal distance and reduced nutrient
                  diffusivity, disrupting spatial networks. This review examines
                  the recent advances in understanding how different types of
                  ecological networks have been restructured by megafaunal
                  extinctions and how this reorganization affected ecosystem
                  functions. ▪ Megafaunal extinctions resulted in the loss of
                  multiple ecological interactions in terrestrial systems. ▪
                  Interaction loss reshaped different types of ecological
                  networks including food webs and spatial networks. ▪ The
                  reorganization of ecological networks changed how terrestrial
                  ecosystems are structured and function. Expected final online

                  both the extent to which organisms experience spatial and
                  temporal environmental variation (exposure) and how responsive
                  they are to the environmental variation (sensitivity).
                  Theoretical models and experiments suggesting substantial
                  potential for thermal adaptation have largely omitted
                  realistic environmental variation. Environmental variation can
                  drive fluctuations in selection that slow adaptive evolution.
                  We review how carefully filtering environmental conditions
                  based on how organisms experience their environment and
                  further considering organismal sensitivity can improve
                  predictions of thermal adaptation. We contrast taxa differing
                  in exposure and sensitivity. Plasticity can increase the rate
                  of evolutionary adaptation in taxa exposed to pronounced
                  environmental variation. However, forms of plasticity that
                  severely limit exposure, such as behavioral thermoregulation
                  and phenological shifts, can hinder thermal adaptation.
                  Despite examples of rapid thermal adaptation, experimental
                  studies often reveal evolutionary constraints. Further
                  investigating these constraints and issues of timescale and
                  thermal history are needed to predict evolutionary adaptation
                  and, consequently, population persistence in changing and

                  complex systems is made difficult due to an evolutionary cost
                  of complexity that is reflected in lower evolvability. This
                  line of reasoning suggests that organisms must have special
                  properties to overcome this cost, such as integration,
                  modularity, and robustness, and that the reduction in the rate
                  of evolution and variational constraints could help explain
                  why organisms might not respond to selection. Here, we discuss
                  the issues that arise from this conviction and highlight an
                  alternative view where complexity represents an opportunity by
                  increasing the evolutionary potential of a population. We

                  diseases. Fluctuating transmission of severe acute respiratory
                  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demonstrated the highly
                  dynamic nature of human social behavior, often without
                  government intervention. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the first
                  two years following spillover resulted primarily in increased
                  transmissibility, while in the third year, the globally
                  dominant virus variants had all evolved substantial immune
                  evasion. The combination of viral evolution and the buildup of
                  host immunity through vaccination and infection greatly
                  decreased the realized virulence of SARS-CoV-2 due to the age

                  tropical forests. Key facets include deforestation driven by
                  agricultural expansion, timber and wood extraction, the loss

                  spread of fire, landscape fragmentation, the spread of
                  second-growth forests, new species invasion and pathogen
                  spread, increasing CO2, and climate change. The patterns of
                  change are spatially heterogeneous, are often characterized by
                  strong interactions among different drivers, can have both
                  large-scale and remote effects, and can play out through

                  population; 2) the growing concentration of human beings; 3)
                  the growing mobility of the human population; 4) the rapid

                  increasing intensification of the farm animal sector; 6)
                  increasing ecological degradation, and 7) the lack of

                  crucial for socioeconomic risk assessments, yet model
                  discrepancies limit their application. Here we use a
                  pattern-filtering technique to identify low-frequency changes
                  in individual members of a multi-model ensemble, to assess
                  discrepancies across models in the projected pattern and
                  magnitude of change. Specifically, we apply low-frequency
                  component analysis (LFCA) to the intensity and frequency of
                  daily precipitation extremes over land in 21 CMIP-6 models.
                  LFCA brings modest but statistically significant improvements
                  in the agreement between models in the spatial pattern of
                  projected change, particularly in scenarios with weak
                  greenhouse forcing. Moreover, we show that LFCA facilitates a
                  robust identification of the rates at which increasing
                  precipitation extremes scale with global temperature change
                  within individual ensemble members. While these rates
                  approximately match expectations from the Clausius-Clapeyron
                  relation on average across models, individual models exhibit
                  considerable and significant differences. Monte-Carlo
                  simulations indicate that these differences contribute to
                  uncertainty in the magnitude of projected change at least as
                  much as differences in the climate sensitivity. Finally, we
                  compare these scaling rates to those identified from
                  observational products, demonstrating that virtually all
                  climate models significantly underestimate the rates at which
                  increases in precipitation extremes have scaled with global
                  temperatures historically. Constraining projections with
                  observations therefore amplifies the projected intensification
                  of precipitation extremes as well as reducing the relative
                  error of their distribution.},

                  wildlife. Some livestock diseases have "spilled over" to
                  wildlife and then "spilled back" to livestock. When a
                  population is exposed to an infectious agent, depending on an
                  interaction of factors involving the host, agent, and
                  environment, the population may be resistant to infection or
                  may become a dead-end host, a spillover host, or a maintenance
                  host. Each exposure is unique; the same species of host and
                  agent may respond differently in different situations.

                  States is reinventing colonialism in the Global South through
                  the domination of digital technology. Using South Africa as a
                  case study, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial
                  control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem:
                  software, hardware and network connectivity, which then gives
                  rise to related forms of domination. The monopoly power of
                  multinational corporations is used for resource extraction
                  through rent and surveillance – economic domination. By
                  controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations
                  control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct
                  power over political, economic and cultural domains of life –
                  imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism,
                  Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates
                  economic power in the hands of US corporations – a system of
                  global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance
                  capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with
                  their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted
                  surveillance in the Global South – which intensifies imperial
                  state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that
                  society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions
                  of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech
                  hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that
                  decentralises technology by placing control directly into the
                  hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier

                  imported cases) depended on air travel volumes, SARS-CoV-2
                  exposure risk in the departure country, prior infection or
                  vaccine acquired immunity, and, for non-essential travellers,
                  screening from pre-departure molecular testing. Importation
                  risk was estimated weekly from July to November 2021 as the
                  number of imported cases and percent positivity (PP; i.e.
                  imported cases normalised by travel volume). The impact of
                  pre-departure testing was assessed by comparing three
                  scenarios: baseline (pre-departure testing of all
                  non-essential travellers; most probable importation risk given
                  the pre-departure testing requirements), counterfactual
                  scenario 1 (no pre-departure testing of fully vaccinated
                  non-essential travellers), and counterfactual scenario 2 (no
                  pre-departure testing of non-essential travellers). RESULTS:
                  In the baseline scenario, weekly imported cases and PP varied
                  over time, ranging from 145 to 539 cases and 0.15 to 0.28\%,
                  respectively. Most cases arrived from the USA, Mexico, the
                  United Kingdom, and France. While modelling suggested that
                  essential travellers had a higher weekly PP (0.37 - 0.65\%)
                  than non-essential travellers (0.12 - 0.24\%), they
                  contributed fewer weekly cases (62 - 154) than non-essential
                  travellers (84 - 398 per week) given their lower travel
                  volume. Pre-departure testing was estimated to reduce imported
                  cases by one third (counterfactual scenario 1) to one half
                  (counterfactual scenario 2). CONCLUSIONS: The model results
                  highlighted the weekly variation in importation by traveller
                  group (e.g., reason for travel and country of departure) and
                  enabled a framework for measuring the impact of pre-departure
                  testing requirements. Quantifying the contributors of
                  importation risk through mathematical simulation can support
                  the design of appropriate public health policy on border
                  measures.},

                  origin present a critical threat to global population health.
                  As accelerating globalisation makes epidemics and pandemics
                  more difficult to contain, there is a need for effective
                  preventive interventions that reduce the risk of zoonotic
                  spillover events. Public policies can play a key role in
                  preventing spillover events. The aim of this review is to
                  identify and describe evaluations of public policies that
                  target the determinants of zoonotic spillover. Our approach is
                  informed by a One Health perspective, acknowledging the
                  inter-connectedness of human, animal and environmental health.
                  Methods In this systematic scoping review, we searched
                  Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021
                  using search terms combining animal health and the
                  animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and
                  zoonoses. We screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and
                  reported our process in line with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We
                  also searched relevant organisations’ websites for evaluations
                  published in the grey literature. All evaluations of public
                  policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events were
                  eligible for inclusion. We summarised key data from each
                  study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway. Results
                  Our review found 95 publications evaluating 111 policies. We
                  identified 27 unique policy options including habitat
                  protection; trade regulations; border control and quarantine
                  procedures; farm and market biosecurity measures; public
                  information campaigns; and vaccination programmes, as well as
                  multi-component programmes. These were implemented by many
                  sectors, highlighting the cross-sectoral nature of zoonotic
                  spillover prevention. Reports emphasised the importance of
                  surveillance data in both guiding prevention efforts and
                  enabling policy evaluation, as well as the importance of
                  industry and private sector actors in implementing many of
                  these policies. Thoughtful engagement with stakeholders
                  ranging from subsistence hunters and farmers to industrial
                  animal agriculture operations is key for policy success in
                  this area. Conclusion This review outlines the state of the
                  evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic
                  spillover in order to guide policy decision-making and focus
                  research efforts. Since we found that most of the existing
                  policy evaluations target ‘downstream’ determinants,
                  additional research could focus on evaluating policies
                  targeting ‘upstream’ determinants of zoonotic spillover, such
                  as land use change, and policies impacting infection intensity
                  and pathogen shedding in animal populations, such as those
                  targeting animal welfare.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Conceptual frameworks are recommended as a way of
                  applying theory to enhance implementation efforts. The
                  Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by
                  Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31
                  planned action theories. The framework has two components:
                  Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which
                  comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two
                  questions: 'Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so,
                  how?' METHODS: This study is a citation analysis and
                  systematic review. The index citation for the original paper
                  was identified on three databases-Web of Science, Scopus and
                  Google Scholar-with the facility for citation searching.
                  Limitations of English language and year of publication
                  2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum
                  of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to
                  implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and
                  mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where
                  it was integral to the implementation project. RESULTS: The
                  citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles
                  and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies
                  described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to
                  integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to
                  the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation
                  activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven
                  referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted
                  in different health care and academic settings with projects
                  targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied
                  health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The KTA Framework is being
                  used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is
                  frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution
                  via a reference, through informing planning, to making an
                  intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to
                  knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways
                  and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages
                  the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet
                  their application is less evident in practice. This may be an
                  artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary
                  research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA
                  Framework and similar tools.},

  abstract     = {Binary classification is a common task for which machine
                  learning and computational statistics are used, and the area
                  under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC)
                  has become the common standard metric to evaluate binary
                  classifications in most scientific fields. The ROC curve has
                  true positive rate (also called sensitivity or recall) on the
                  y axis and false positive rate on the x axis, and the ROC AUC
                  can range from 0 (worst result) to 1 (perfect result). The ROC
                  AUC, however, has several flaws and drawbacks. This score is
                  generated including predictions that obtained insufficient
                  sensitivity and specificity, and moreover it does not say
                  anything about positive predictive value (also known as
                  precision) nor negative predictive value (NPV) obtained by the
                  classifier, therefore potentially generating inflated
                  overoptimistic results. Since it is common to include ROC AUC
                  alone without precision and negative predictive value, a
                  researcher might erroneously conclude that their
                  classification was successful. Furthermore, a given point in
                  the ROC space does not identify a single confusion matrix nor
                  a group of matrices sharing the same MCC value. Indeed, a
                  given (sensitivity, specificity) pair can cover a broad MCC
                  range, which casts doubts on the reliability of ROC AUC as a
                  performance measure. In contrast, the Matthews correlation
                  coefficient (MCC) generates a high score in its [Formula: see
                  text] interval only if the classifier scored a high value for
                  all the four basic rates of the confusion matrix: sensitivity,
                  specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. A high
                  MCC (for example, MCC [Formula: see text] 0.9), moreover,
                  always corresponds to a high ROC AUC, and not vice versa. In
                  this short study, we explain why the Matthews correlation
                  coefficient should replace the ROC AUC as standard statistic
                  in all the scientific studies involving a binary
                  classification, in all scientific fields.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In 2014, Western Africa experienced an
                  unanticipated explosion of Ebola virus infections. What
                  distinguishes fatal from non-fatal outcomes remains largely
                  unknown, yet is key to optimising personalised treatment
                  strategies. We used transcriptome data for peripheral blood
                  taken from infected and convalescent recovering patients to
                  identify early stage host factors that are associated with
                  acute illness and those that differentiate patient survival
                  from fatality. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that individuals
                  who succumbed to the disease show stronger upregulation of
                  interferon signalling and acute phase responses compared to
                  survivors during the acute phase of infection. Particularly
                  notable is the strong upregulation of albumin and fibrinogen
                  genes, which suggest significant liver pathology. Cell subtype
                  prediction using messenger RNA expression patterns indicated
                  that NK-cell populations increase in patients who survive
                  infection. By selecting genes whose expression properties
                  discriminated between fatal cases and survivors, we identify a
                  small panel of responding genes that act as strong predictors
                  of patient outcome, independent of viral load. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Transcriptomic analysis of the host response to pathogen
                  infection using blood samples taken during an outbreak
                  situation can provide multiple levels of information on both
                  disease state and mechanisms of pathogenesis. Host biomarkers
                  were identified that provide high predictive value under
                  conditions where other predictors, such as viral load, are
                  poor prognostic indicators. The data suggested that rapid
                  analysis of the host response to infection in an outbreak
                  situation can provide valuable information to guide an
                  understanding of disease outcome and mechanisms of disease.},

                  semi-urban regions near managed and natural wetlands evidenced
                  by recent outbreaks of Usutu and West Nile viruses. While
                  wetland management policies focus on biodiversity and
                  ecosystem services, few studies explore the impact on mosquito
                  vectors. Methods Our research addresses this gap, examining
                  juvenile mosquito and aquatic predator communities in 67 ditch
                  sites within a South England coastal marsh subjected to
                  different wetland management tiers. Using joint distribution
                  models, we analyse how mosquito communities respond to abiotic
                  and biotic factors influenced by wetland management. Results
                  Of the 12 mosquito species identified, Culiseta annulata
                  (Usutu virus vector) and Culex pipiens (Usutu and West Nile
                  virus vector) constitute 47\% of 6825 larval mosquitoes.
                  Abundant predators include Coleoptera (water beetles) adults,
                  Corixidae (water boatmen) and Zygoptera (Damselfy) larvae.
                  Models reveal that tier 3 management sites (higher winter
                  water levels, lower agricultural intensity) associated with
                  shade and less floating vegetation are preferred by specific
                  mosquito species. All mosquito species except Anopheles
                  maculipennis s.l., are negatively impacted by potential
                  predators. Culiseta annulata shows positive associations with
                  shaded and turbid water, contrary to preferences of Corixidae
                  predators. Conclusions Tier 3 areas managed for biodiversity,
                  characterised by higher seasonal water levels and reduced
                  livestock grazing intensity, provide favourable habitats for
                  key mosquito species that are known vectors of arboviruses,
                  such as Usutu and West Nile. Our findings emphasise the impact
                  of biodiversity-focused wetland management, altering mosquito
                  breeding site vegetation to enhance vector suitability.
                  Further exploration of these trade-offs is crucial for
                  comprehending the broader implications of wetland management.},

                  health and socioeconomic problems worldwide. Understanding how
                  viruses evolve and spread within and among wildlife species is
                  a critical step when aiming for proactive identification of
                  viral threats to prevent future pandemics. Despite the many
                  proposed factors influencing viral diversity, the genomic
                  diversity and structure of viral communities in East Africa
                  are largely unknown. Results Using 38.3 Tb of
                  metatranscriptomic data obtained via ultradeep sequencing, we
                  screened vertebrate-associated viromes from 844 bats and 250
                  rodents from Kenya and Uganda collected from the wild. The 251
                  vertebrate-associated viral genomes of bats (212) and rodents
                  (39) revealed the vast diversity, host-related variability,
                  and high geographic specificity of viruses in East Africa.
                  Among the surveyed viral families, Coronaviridae and
                  Circoviridae showed low host specificity, high conservation of
                  replication-associated proteins, high divergence among viral
                  entry proteins, and frequent recombination. Despite major
                  dispersal limitations, recurrent mutations, cocirculation, and
                  occasional gene flow contribute to the high local diversity of
                  viral genomes. Conclusions The present study not only shows
                  the landscape of bat and rodent viromes in this zoonotic
                  hotspot but also reveals genomic signatures driven by the
                  evolution and dispersal of the viral community, laying solid
                  groundwork for future proactive surveillance of emerging
                  zoonotic pathogens in wildlife.},

                  allowing a stakeholder to more easily "see" the structure of

                  take action and make meaningful programmatic changes based on

               important and vampire bat control is the key to eliminating the
               problem. Less appreciated is the increased abundance of the
               common vampire bat in tropical America, brought about by man's
               activities. The principal reason to control vampire bats is their
               role as a vector of rabies and their predation on domestic
               animals. In 1972 two new vampire bat control methods, based on
               two different applications of an anticoagulant were described.
               These methods, one topical, the second systemic, if properly
               applied, have removed the risk of traumatic death to operators
               and are relatively species-specific in killing vampire bats. With
               the exception of the strychnine technique, previous methods for
               controlling vampires required knowing the location of their
               roosts. It is not necessary to know the location of the roosts,
               and it is likely that several nearby vampire colonies are being
               destroyed simultaneously.},

                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of
                  how modular the network is) and different module compositions
                  (i.e. different groups of species forming said modules). More

                  network approach has improved the understanding about
                  community structuring, few aspects such as the temporal
                  variation in the species’ activity pattern in the networks’
                  topology were explored so far. The current study used the
                  ecological network approach to investigate ants interacting in
                  the extrafloral nectary (EFN) of plants in order to test the
                  hypothesis that the temporal variation in the foraging
                  behavior of these animals affects the networks’ topology. In
                  order to assess the temporal effect on the interaction
                  networks, 24-hour collections divided in two 12-hour shifts
                  (day and night) were performed in 20 plots, thus totaling 288
                  collection hours over 6 months. The ant-plant interaction
                  networks presented similarity among the topological metrics
                  assessed throughout the day. Different ant species presented
                  distinct foraging times. Thus, two modules referring to the
                  day and night shifts emerged from the network and presented
                  specific species at each foraging shift. On the other hand,
                  the plants kept on providing the resource (active EFNs)
                  throughout the day. The results found in the current study
                  have shown that ecological networks keep their structures
                  constant; however, the ecological processes ruling these
                  networks can better respond to the effects caused, for
                  example, by the temporal variation in species’ activity.
                  Therefore, it is worth always taking into consideration the
                  importance of ecological processes at the time to analyze
                  interactions in the nature.}

                  good practices in scientific programming. While most life

                  analysis are often missing. We propose a model on how to build
                  such a community of practice at a local academic institution,
                  present two real-life examples, and introduce challenges and

                  inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species
                  involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility
                  to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary
                  timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of
                  mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture
                  root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our
                  "backbone-and-patch" approach to tree building applies a newly
                  assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian
                  inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major
                  lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2)
                  species-level "patch" phylogenies with nonoverlapping
                  in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage
                  in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded
                  ("DNA-only" trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints
                  using branch lengths drawn from local birth-death models
                  ("completed" trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones
                  results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all
                  branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby
                  facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as
                  marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees
                  to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence
                  times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among
                  studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are
                  estimated more accurately in our study than in previous
                  "supertree" approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to
                  branch-length artifacts. Credible sets of mammalian

                  place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early
                  SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate
                  evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in
                  humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and
                  purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in
                  related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects
                  evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying
                  selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage

                  in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of
                  antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest
                  bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about
                  1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes

                  early investigation and outbreak preparedness. Given the

                  otherwise sparse knowledge of the biology of newly discovered
                  viruses, we developed machine learning models that identify
                  candidate zoonoses solely using signatures of host range
                  encoded in viral genomes. Within a dataset of 861 viral
                  species with known zoonotic status, our approach outperformed
                  models based on the phylogenetic relatedness of viruses to
                  known human-infecting viruses (area under the receiver
                  operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.773), distinguishing
                  high-risk viruses within families that contain a minority of
                  human-infecting species and identifying putatively undetected
                  or so far unrealized zoonoses. Analyses of the underpinnings
                  of model predictions suggested the existence of generalizable
                  features of viral genomes that are independent of virus
                  taxonomic relationships and that may preadapt viruses to
                  infect humans. Our model reduced a second set of 645
                  animal-associated viruses that were excluded from training to
                  272 high and 41 very high-risk candidate zoonoses and showed
                  significantly elevated predicted zoonotic risk in viruses from
                  nonhuman primates, but not other mammalian or avian host
                  groups. A second application showed that our models could have
                  identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
                  (SARS-CoV-2) as a relatively high-risk coronavirus strain and
                  that this prediction required no prior knowledge of zoonotic
                  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-related
                  coronaviruses. Genome-based zoonotic risk assessment provides
                  a rapid, low-cost approach to enable evidence-driven virus
                  surveillance and increases the feasibility of downstream

                  data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such
                  sample augmentation or “N-hacking” is condemned because it can
                  lead to an excess of false positives, which can reduce the

                  of unlimited extra samples to achieve statistical
                  significance, or doing so when results are not even close to

                  ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical
                  inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically
                  well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and
                  approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed.
                  Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates
                  the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection.
                  ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in
                  particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in
                  biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology,
                  epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  abstract     = {According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60\%
                  of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources. In many
                  public health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert
                  Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of public health agents
                  sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect
                  relevant events. This media screening is one important part of
                  event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles,
                  discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a
                  database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also
                  to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it
                  describes relevant, we developed a natural language processing
                  framework for automated information extraction and relevance
                  scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at
                  the RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and
                  automatically extracted the articles' key data: disease,
                  country, date, and confirmed-case count. For this, we
                  performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an
                  open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many
                  different possibilities for each. We extracted the key country
                  and disease using a heuristic with good results. We trained a
                  naive Bayes classifier to find the key date and confirmed-case
                  count, using the RKI's EBS database as labels which performed
                  modestly. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes
                  to which any article might belong: The article is relevant if
                  it is in the EBS database and irrelevant otherwise. We
                  compared the performance of different classifiers, using
                  bag-of-words, document and word embeddings. The best
                  classifier, a logistic regression, achieved a sensitivity of
                  0.82 and an index balanced accuracy of 0.61. Finally, we
                  integrated these functionalities into a web application called
                  EventEpi where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and
                  put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or
                  text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the
                  database. Each of these steps could be improved, in particular
                  with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning
                  algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well
                  and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS.

  abstract     = {A ubiquitous pattern in ecological systems is that more
                  abundant species tend to be more generalist; that is, they
                  interact with more species or can occur in wider range of
                  habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism
                  drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives
                  generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct
                  direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma,
                  previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on
                  formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism.
                  Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding
                  skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal
                  discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on
                  information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work,
                  all three independent methods strongly indicate that
                  generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on
                  plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we
                  find that selection processes are more important than drift
                  processes in structuring multispecies systems when the
                  environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the
                  computational causal discovery approach to aid ecological

                  documentation in improving research quality and impact.
                  Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive
                  text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic,
                  and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by
                  nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when
                  producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of
                  this tool in research publication is not common, despite its
                  potential to increase research impact and quality. For a
                  single study, the content of such documentation partially
                  overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the
                  scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to
                  minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files
                  related to these contents and optimize their production, we
                  present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of
                  computational notebooks in the research process, including

                  notebook integrated into a research project that employs R,
                  Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we

                  reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for

                  gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research
                  workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective
                  starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice

  abstract     = {Food webs are complex ecological networks whose structure is
                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

  abstract     = {Until recently, most ecological network analyses investigating
                  the effects of species’ declines and extinctions have focused
                  on a single type of interaction (e.g. feeding). In nature,
                  however, diverse interactions co-occur, each of them forming a
                  layer of a ‘multilayer’ network. Data including information on
                  multiple interaction types has recently started to emerge,
                  giving us the opportunity to have a first glance at possible
                  commonalities in the structure of these networks. We studied
                  the structural features of 44 tripartite ecological networks
                  from the literature, each composed of two layers of
                  interactions (e.g. herbivory and pollination), and
                  investigated their robustness to species losses. Considering
                  two interactions simultaneously, we found that the robustness
                  of the whole community is a combination of the robustness of
                  the two ecological networks composing it. The way in which the
                  layers of interactions are connected to each other affects the
                  interdependence of their robustness. In many networks, this
                  interdependence is low, suggesting that restoration efforts
                  would not automatically propagate through the whole community.
                  Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple
                  interactions simultaneously to better gauge the robustness of
                  ecological communities to species loss and to more reliably
                  identify key species that are important for the persistence of
                  ecological communities.},

                  generations of biologists and remain controversial. Microbes
                  pose a particular challenge because of their genetic
                  diversity, asexual reproduction, and often promiscuous
                  horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, microbes also present
                  an opportunity to study and understand speciation because of
                  their rapid evolution, both in nature and in the lab, and
                  small, easily sequenced genomes. Here, we review how microbial
                  population genomics has enabled us to catch speciation "in the
                  act" and how the results have challenged and enriched our
                  concepts of species, with implications for all domains of
                  life. We describe how recombination (including HGT and
                  introgression) has shaped the genomes of nascent microbial,
                  animal, and plant species and argue for a prominent role of
                  natural selection in initiating and maintaining speciation. We
                  ask how universal is the process of speciation across the tree
                  of life, and what lessons can be drawn from microbes?
                  Comparative genomics showing the extent of HGT in natural
                  populations certainly jeopardizes the relevance of vertical
                  descent (i.e., the species tree) in speciation. Nevertheless,
                  we conclude that species do indeed exist as clusters of
                  genetic and ecological similarity and that speciation is
                  driven primarily by natural selection, regardless of the
                  balance between horizontal and vertical descent.},

                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal

                  to humans as novel strains occasionally emerge from the avian
                  population to cause human infections. Many past epidemic as
                  well as pandemic strains have originated from avian species.
                  While most viruses are restricted to their primary hosts,
                  zoonotic strains can sometimes arise from mutations or
                  reassortment, leading them to acquire the capability to escape
                  host species barrier and successfully infect a new host.
                  Phylogenetic analyses and genetic markers are useful in
                  tracing the origins of zoonotic infections, but there are
                  still no effective means to identify high risk strains prior
                  to an outbreak. Here we show that distinct host tropism
                  protein signatures can be used to identify possible zoonotic
                  strains in avian species which have the potential to cause
                  human infections. We have discovered that influenza A viruses
                  can now be classified into avian, human, or zoonotic strains
                  based on their host tropism protein signatures. Analysis of
                  all influenza A viruses with complete proteome using the host
                  tropism prediction system, based on machine learning
                  classifications of avian and human viral proteins has
                  uncovered distinct signatures of zoonotic strains as mosaics
                  of avian and human viral proteins. This is in contrast with
                  typical avian or human strains where they show mostly avian or
                  human viral proteins in their signatures respectively.
                  Moreover, we have found that zoonotic strains from the same
                  influenza outbreaks carry similar host tropism protein
                  signatures characteristic of a common ancestry. Our results
                  demonstrate that the distinct host tropism protein signature
                  in zoonotic strains may prove useful in influenza surveillance
                  to rapidly identify potential high risk strains circulating in
                  avian species, which may grant us the foresight in
                  anticipating an impending influenza outbreak.},

                  SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric
                  soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange
                  Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse
                  fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and
                  200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and
                  distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base
                  (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers
                  in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles
                  used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil
                  covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM
                  DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and
                  lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine
                  learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or
                  multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R
                  packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of
                  10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain
                  between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation
                  with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative
                  accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in
                  comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km
                  spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can
                  be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of
                  linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in
                  preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to
                  insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of
                  SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate
                  input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability
                  distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial
                  modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially
                  hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is
                  the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids
                  predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products
                  (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more
                  accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can
                  be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base

  abstract     = {The ensemble method random forests has become a popular
                  classification tool in bioinformatics and related fields. The
                  out-of-bag error is an error estimation technique often used
                  to evaluate the accuracy of a random forest and to select
                  appropriate values for tuning parameters, such as the number
                  of candidate predictors that are randomly drawn for a split,
                  referred to as mtry. However, for binary classification
                  problems with metric predictors it has been shown that the
                  out-of-bag error can overestimate the true prediction error
                  depending on the choices of random forests parameters. Based
                  on simulated and real data this paper aims to identify
                  settings for which this overestimation is likely. It is,
                  moreover, questionable whether the out-of-bag error can be
                  used in classification tasks for selecting tuning parameters
                  like mtry, because the overestimation is seen to depend on the
                  parameter mtry. The simulation-based and real-data based
                  studies with metric predictor variables performed in this
                  paper show that the overestimation is largest in balanced
                  settings and in settings with few observations, a large number
                  of predictor variables, small correlations between predictors
                  and weak effects. There was hardly any impact of the
                  overestimation on tuning parameter selection. However,
                  although the prediction performance of random forests was not
                  substantially affected when using the out-of-bag error for
                  tuning parameter selection in the present studies, one cannot
                  be sure that this applies to all future data. For settings
                  with metric predictor variables it is therefore strongly
                  recommended to use stratified subsampling with sampling
                  fractions that are proportional to the class sizes for both
                  tuning parameter selection and error estimation in random
                  forests. This yielded less biased estimates of the true
                  prediction error. In unbalanced settings, in which there is a

                  the geographic distributions of animal or plant species.
                  However, it only produces point estimates for the probability
                  of species existence. To understand the uncertainty of the
                  point estimates, we analytically derived the variance of the
                  outputs of the maximum entropy model from the variance of the
                  input. We applied the analytic method to obtain the standard
                  deviation of dengue importation probability and Aedes aegypti
                  suitability. Dengue occurrence data and Aedes aegypti mosquito
                  abundance data, combined with demographic and environmental
                  data, were applied to obtain point estimates and the
                  corresponding variance. To address the issue of not having the

                  the performance of the analytical expression with the

                  of equivalence of maximum entropy model with the assumption of

                  probability and Aedes aegypti mosquito suitability examples
                  show that the methods generate comparatively the same results
                  and the analytic method we introduced is dramatically faster
                  than the bootstrap method and directly apply to maximum

                  mouse,Peromyscus leucopus, are considered the primary
                  reservoir of many emerging tick-borne pathogens, the
                  contribution of birds, as alternative hosts and reservoirs, to
                  local transmission cycles has not yet been firmly established.
                  From 2016 to 2018, we collected host-seeking ticks and
                  examined rodent and bird hosts for ticks at 48 sites in a park
                  where blacklegged ticks are established in Quebec, Canada, in
                  order to characterize the distribution of pathogens in ticks
                  and mammalian and avian hosts. We found nearly one third of
                  captured birds (n = 849) and 70\% of small mammals (n = 694)
                  were infested withI.scapularis. Five bird and three mammal
                  species transmittedBorrelia burgdorferito feeding larvae (n
                  larvae tested = 2257) and we estimated that about one fifth of
                  theB.burgdorferi-infected questing nymphs in the park acquired
                  their infection from birds, the remaining being attributable
                  to mice. Ground-foraging bird species were more parasitized
                  than other birds, and species that inhabited open habitat were
                  more frequently infested and were more likely to
                  transmitB.burgdorferito larval ticks feeding upon them. Female
                  birds were more likely to transmit infection than males,
                  without age differentiation, whereas in mice, adult males were
                  more likely to transmit infection than juveniles and females.
                  We also detectedBorrelia miyamotoiin larvae collected from

                  a white-footed mouse. This study highlights the importance of

                  production and crop pollination, raising concern for wild
                  pollinators, as honey bees may compete with wild pollinators
                  for floral resources. The first sign of competition, before
                  changes appear in wild pollinator abundance or diversity, may
                  be changes to wild pollinator interactions with plants. Such
                  changes for a community can be measured by looking at changes
                  to metrics of resource use overlap in plant-pollinator
                  interaction networks. Studies of honey bee effects on
                  plant-pollinator networks have usually not distinguished
                  whether honey bees alter wild pollinator interactions, or if
                  they merely alter total network structure by adding their own
                  interactions. To test this question, we experimentally
                  introduced honey bees to a Canadian grassland and measured
                  plant-pollinator interactions at varying distances from the
                  introduced hives. We found that honey bees increased the
                  network metrics of pollinator and plant functional
                  complementarity and decreased interaction evenness. However,
                  in networks constructed from just wild pollinator
                  interactions, honey bee abundance did not affect any of the
                  metrics calculated. Thus, all network structural changes to
                  the full network (including honey bee interactions) were due
                  only to honey bee-plant interactions, and not to honey bees
                  causing changes in wild pollinator-plant interactions. Given
                  widespread and increasing use of honey bees, it is important
                  to establish whether they affect wild pollinator communities.
                  Our results suggest that honey bees did not alter wild
                  pollinator foraging patterns in this system, even in a year
                  that was drier than the 20-year average.},

                  of bats, and therefore the transmission dynamics of viruses.
                  Within bat roosts the density and contact rate among
                  individuals increase and may facilitate the transmission of
                  bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Landscape components supporting
                  larger bat populations may thus lead to higher CoVs
                  prevalence, as the number of roosts and/or roost size are
                  likely to be higher. Hence, relationships between landscape
                  composition and the presence of CoVs are expected to exist. To
                  increase our understanding of the spread and shedding of
                  coronaviruses in bat populations we studied the relationships
                  between landscape composition and CoVs prevalence in the
                  species Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus nathusii.
                  Faecal samples were collected across The Netherlands, and were
                  screened to detect the presence of CoV RNA. Coordinates were
                  recorded for all faecal samples, so that landscape attributes
                  could be quantified. Using a backward selection procedure on
                  the basis of AIC, the landscape variables that best explained
                  the presence of CoVs were selected in the final model. Results
                  suggested that relationships between landscape composition and
                  CoVs were likely associated with optimal foraging
                  opportunities in both species, e.g. nearby water in P.
                  nathusii or in areas with more grassland situated far away
                  from forests for P. pipistrellus. Surprisingly, we found no
                  positive association between built-up cover (where roosts are
                  frequently found) and the presence of bat-CoVs for both
                  species. We also show that samples collected from large bat
                  roosts, such as maternity colonies, substantially increased
                  the probability of finding CoVs in P. pipistrellus.
                  Interestingly, while maternity colonies of P. nathusii are
                  rarely present in The Netherlands, CoVs prevalence was similar
                  in both species, suggesting that other mechanisms besides
                  roost size, participate in the transmission of bat-CoVs. We
                  encourage further studies to quantify bat roosts and colony
                  networks over the different landscape compositions to better
                  understand the ecological mechanisms involved in the

                  homogenization in urbanized landscapes, there are increasing
                  efforts to conserve and increase biodiversity within urban
                  areas. Accordingly, around the world, previously extirpated
                  species are (re)colonizing and otherwise infiltrating urban
                  landscapes, while other species are disappearing from these
                  landscapes. Tracking the occurrence of traditionally urban
                  intolerant species and loss of traditionally urban tolerant
                  species should be a management goal of urban areas, but we
                  generally lack tools to study this phenomenon. To address this
                  gap, we first used species’ occurrences from iNaturalist, a
                  large collaborative dataset of species observations, to
                  calculate an urban association index (UAI) for 967 native
                  animal species that occur in the city of Los Angeles. On
                  average, the occurrence of native species was negatively
                  associated with our composite measure of urban intensity, with
                  the exception of snails and slugs, which instead occur more
                  frequently in areas of increased urban intensity. Next, we
                  assessed 8,348 0.25 x 0.25 mile grids across the City of Los
                  Angeles to determine the average grid-level UAI scores (i.e.,
                  a summary of the UAIs present in a grid cell, which we term
                  Community Urban Tolerance Index or CUTI). We found that areas
                  of higher urban intensity host more urban tolerant species,
                  but also that taxonomic groups differ in their aggregate
                  tolerance of urban areas, and that spatial patterns of
                  tolerance vary between groups. The framework established here
                  has been designed to be iteratively reevaluated by city
                  managers of Los Angeles in order to track the progress of
                  initiatives to preserve and encourage urban biodiversity, but
                  can be rescaled to sample different regions within the city or
                  different cities altogether to provide a valuable tool for

                  has been documented in eastern Canada (Québec); however, Sin
                  Nombre virus-infected deer mice have been identified across
                  the country. Although cases are rare (yearly case numbers
                  range from zero to 13 and the total number of confirmed cases
                  in Canada now total 109), the mortality rate among infected
                  individuals is approximately 30\%. The majority of cases occur
                  in the spring and early summer indicating
                  seasonally-associated risk factors for viral exposure. In 2013
                  and 2014, a substantial increase in the number of hantavirus
                  pulmonary syndrome cases was identified; however the cause
                  remains unclear. No antivirals or vaccines are currently
                  available and treatment is supportive. Public education,
                  rodent control and the use of personal protective measures are
                  key to avoid infections in at-risk populations.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Cases of Lyme disease and areas with
                  self-sustaining populations of vector ticks are increasing in
                  Canada. This trend is expected to continue. Preventing Lyme
                  disease will therefore become relevant to an increasing number
                  of Canadians. OBJECTIVE: To summarize methods for reducing the
                  risk of tick bites and preventing transmission once a tick is
                  feeding. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to
                  identify methods to reduce the risk of tick bites and the
                  abundance of vector ticks, as well as the risk of becoming
                  infected with the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi
                  (BB), if bitten by a vector tick. RESULTS: Current approaches
                  to reducing the risk of tick bites or preventing infection
                  with BB once bitten are largely reliant on the individual.
                  They include use of topical repellents, use of protective
                  clothing, avoidance of risk areas and removing ticks soon
                  (ideally within a day) after they attach. These methods are
                  efficacious, but constrained by user adherence. Other
                  approaches such as landscape modification or the use of
                  acaricides to control ticks, have shown promise in other
                  countries, but have not been widely adopted in Canada.
                  CONCLUSION: Lyme disease will continue to present a threat in
                  Canada. In additional to the existing interventions for
                  prevention of tick bites and Lyme disease, there is a need for
                  new tools to help reduce the risk of Lyme disease to
                  Canadians.},

                  Extensive research has demonstrated that maintaining
                  biodiversity promotes ocean health and service provision;
                  therefore, monitoring the status and trends of marine
                  biodiversity is important for effective ecosystem management.
                  However, there is no systematic sustained program for
                  evaluating ocean biodiversity. Coordinating existing
                  monitoring and building a proactive marine biodiversity

                  infections in a significant way. However, increased
                  consumption has led to an exposure of bacterial communities

                  ways. The development of forecast models is necessary for
                  proactive disease management, but past studies have frequently
                  reported thermal performance data in idiosyncratic ways that
                  have limited use for parameterizing thermal host-parasite
                  models. Development of improved forecast models will require
                  strong collaborations between experimental parasitologists and
                  disease modelers. The purpose of this article is to facilitate
                  such collaborations by reviewing practical considerations for
                  describing thermal performance curves of parasite and host
                  performance traits, and using them to predict climate change
                  impacts on host-parasite systems. In the first section, we
                  provide an overview of how thermal performance curves can be
                  embedded in life-cycle-based dynamical models of parasitism,
                  and we outline how such models can capture the net effect of
                  multiple nonlinear temperature dependencies affecting the
                  host-parasite dynamics. We also discuss how macroecological
                  generalities based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE)
                  can be used to determine a priori parameter estimates for
                  thermal performance curves to derive null models for
                  data-deficient species, but we note that most of the
                  generalities suggested by MTE remain to be tested for
                  parasites. In the second section, we discuss empirical
                  knowledge gaps for the temperature dependence of parasite and
                  host performance traits, and we outline the types of data that
                  need to be collected to inform MTE-based models for
                  data-deficient species. We specifically emphasize the
                  importance of (1) capturing the entire thermal response of
                  performance traits, including lower and upper temperature
                  thresholds, and (2) experimentally or statistically separating
                  out the thermal responses of different performance traits
                  (e.g., development and mortality) rather than only reporting
                  composite measures (e.g., apparent development). Not adhering
                  to these principles can lead to biased climate change impact
                  predictions. In the third section, we provide a practical
                  guide outlining how experimentalists can contribute to fill
                  data gaps by measuring the temperature dependence of host and
                  parasite performance traits in ways that are systematic,
                  statistically rigorous, and consistent with the requirements
                  of life cycle-based host-parasite models. This guide includes
                  recommendations and practical examples illustrating (1) the
                  use of perturbation analyses to determine experimental
                  priorities, (2) experimental design tips for quantifying
                  thermal response curves, and (3) statistical methods for
                  estimating the parameters of thermal performance curves. Our
                  hope is that this article helps researchers to maximize the
                  value and use of future data collections for both empirical
                  and modelling studies investigating the way in which
                  temperature influences parasitism.},

                  In the past 10 years, numerous studies have reported that – in
                  many contexts – generalist species are “replacing” specialist
                  species. We review recent research on the concept of the
                  ecological niche and species specialization, and conclude that
                  (1) the observed worldwide decline in specialist species is
                  predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause
                  “functional homogenization” of biodiversity, and (3) such
                  homogenization may be used to measure the impact of
                  disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community
                  level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as
                  well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and
                  services. We propose community‐level specialization as an

                  absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using
                  data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species
                  distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show
                  that this procedure is highly sensitive to "spatial sorting

                  distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null
                  model that only considers the geographic distance to training

                  Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias,
                  yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC
                  was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This

                  We tested two ideas related to the degree of ecological
                  determinism vs. stochasticity using a large data set
                  comprising bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton. We expected
                  that (1) there are predictable, size-driven differences in the
                  degree to which planktonic taxa respond to different drivers
                  such as water chemistry, biotic interactions, and climatic
                  variables; and (2) species distribution models show lowest
                  predictive performance for the smallest taxa due to the
                  stochastic distributions of microbes. Generalized linear
                  models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), and
                  generalized boosted methods (GBMs) were constructed for 84
                  species to model their occurrence as a function of eight
                  predictors. Predictive performance was measured as the area
                  under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic
                  plot and true skill statistic (TSS) using independent model
                  evaluation data. We found that the model performances were
                  typically remarkably low for all planktonic groups. The
                  proportion of satisfactory models (AUC > 0.7) was lowest for
                  bacteria (11.1\% of the models), followed by phyto- (24.2\%)
                  and zooplankton (38.1\%). The occurrences of taxa within all
                  planktonic groups were related to climatic variables to a
                  certain degree, but bacteria showed the strongest associations
                  with the climatic variables. Moreover, zooplankton occurrences
                  were more related to biotic variables than the occurrences of
                  smaller taxa, while phytoplankton occurrences were more
                  related to water chemistry. We conclude that the occurrences
                  of planktonic taxa are highly unpredictable and that
                  stochasticity in occurrences is negatively related to the
                  organism size perhaps due to efficient dispersal and fast
                  population dynamics among the smallest taxa.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental ecological modeling task is to estimate the
                  probability that a species is present in (or uses) a site,
                  conditional on environmental variables. For many species,
                  available data consist of "presence" data (locations where the
                  species [or evidence of it] has been observed), together with
                  "background" data, a random sample of available environmental
                  conditions. Recently published papers disagree on whether
                  probability of presence is identifiable from such
                  presence-background data alone. This paper aims to resolve the
                  disagreement, demonstrating that additional information is
                  required. We defined seven simulated species representing
                  various simple shapes of response to environmental variables
                  (constant, linear, convex, unimodal, S-shaped) and ran five
                  logistic model-fitting methods using 1000 presence samples and
                  10 000 background samples; the simulations were repeated 100
                  times. The experiment revealed a stark contrast between two
                  groups of methods: those based on a strong assumption that
                  species' true probability of presence exactly matches a given
                  parametric form had highly variable predictions and much
                  larger RMS error than methods that take population prevalence
                  (the fraction of sites in which the species is present) as an
                  additional parameter. For six species, the former group
                  grossly under- or overestimated probability of presence. The
                  cause was not model structure or choice of link function,
                  because all methods were logistic with linear and, where
                  necessary, quadratic terms. Rather, the experiment
                  demonstrates that an estimate of prevalence is not just
                  helpful, but is necessary (except in special cases) for
                  identifying probability of presence. We therefore advise
                  against use of methods that rely on the strong assumption, due
                  to Lele and Keim (recently advocated by Royle et al.) and
                  Lancaster and Imbens. The methods are fragile, and their
                  strong assumption is unlikely to be true in practice. We
                  emphasize, however, that we are not arguing against standard
                  statistical methods such as logistic regression, generalized
                  linear models, and so forth, none of which requires the strong
                  assumption. If probability of presence is required for a given
                  application, there is no panacea for lack of data.
                  Presence-background data must be augmented with an additional
                  datum, e.g., species' prevalence, to reliably estimate
                  absolute (rather than relative) probability of presence.},

                  hypotheses regarding the potential distributions of species
                  under different environmental conditions, such as forecasts of
                  species range shifts in response to climate change and
                  predictions of invasive species range expansions. However, an
                  accurate description of species' geographic ranges as a
                  function of the environment requires that species observations
                  and climatic variables are measured at the same spatial and
                  temporal resolution, which is usually not the case. Weather
                  station data are interpolated and these resulting continuous
                  data layers are incorporated into SDMs, often without any
                  uncertainty assessment. Here we quantify the effects of three
                  unrelated but complementary aspects of uncertainty in weather
                  station interpolations on SDM performance using MaxEnt. We
                  examine the influence of topographic heterogeneity,
                  interannual variability, and distance to station on the over‐
                  and under‐prediction of modeled North American bird
                  distributions. Our species observations are derived from
                  presence‐absence information for 20 bird species with
                  well‐known distributions. These three metrics of uncertainty
                  in interpolated weather station data have varying
                  contributions to over‐ and under‐prediction errors in SDMs.
                  Topographic heterogeneity had the highest contribution to
                  omission errors; the lowest contribution to commission errors
                  was from Euclidean distance to station. The results confirm
                  the importance of establishing an appropriate relational basis
                  in time and space between species and climatic layers,
                  providing key operational criteria for selection of species
                  observations fed into SDMs. Our findings highlight the
                  importance of identifying weather stations locations used in
                  interpolated products, which will allow a characterization of
                  some aspects of uncertainty and identification of regions
                  where users need to be particularly careful when making a
                  decision based on a SDM.},

                  population dynamics, conservation biology, biogeography, and
                  evolutionary ecology. Recently, methodological advances have
                  been achieved by adopting modeling principles from statistical
                  and machine learning. One such principle that has not been
                  explored is that voted ensembles of weakly tuned (underfit)
                  models often exhibit similar bias and lower variance than
                  individual well‐tuned models. A further contribution of
                  machine learning is the one class support vector machine. One
                  class support vector machines may be more suited to ecological
                  niche modeling than classification algorithms because the
                  “boundary estimation” property of this class of models better
                  represents the conception of the niche as the set of
                  environments in which populations of a species persist. This
                  paper brings together these approaches and applies them to a
                  data set on the distribution two‐spined blackfish (Gadopsis
                  bispinosus) in southeastern Australia with the aim of
                  improving performance and enriching the repertoire of methods
                  for ecological niche modeling. First, a study of low‐bias
                  bagging (LOBAG) applied to conventional two‐class support
                  vector machines, an approach to presence‐background modeling,
                  found this method to be comparable to another widely used
                  method, MAXENT. Next, I introduce a variant of LOBAG for one
                  class classification, LOBAG‐OC, to be used for ecological
                  niche modeling with presence‐only data. This method performed
                  better than other presence‐only methods (DOMAIN and BIOCLIM)
                  and nearly as well as LOBAG and MAXENT, despite the fact that
                  the presence‐only problem is considerably more difficult than
                  the corresponding presence‐background problem. Results of
                  these analyses suggest that LOBAG and LOBAG‐OC may provide
                  robust, high‐performing solutions to the presence‐background
                  and presence‐only modeling problems and point to ways in which
                  ecological niche modeling may be simultaneously both improved
                  and automated.},

                  availability are two of the main factors responsible for
                  plasticity in habitat selection. Despite the need for habitat
                  selection models that can accurately predict animal
                  distribution given the plasticity in the selection process, no
                  study has assessed the synergistic effects of these factors on
                  habitat selection. We investigated density‐dependent
                  functional responses by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped
                  skunks (Mephitis mephitis), two of the main hosts of the
                  rabies virus in North America. We monitored 54 raccoons and 12
                  striped skunks with Global‐Positioning‐System collars in a
                  landscape dominated by corn fields and forest patches. We
                  built resource selection functions to evaluate if the
                  selection of corn fields varied with conspecific density and
                  corn field availability within 100\% minimum convex polygons.
                  Raccoons altered their selection of corn fields depending on
                  both conspecific density and corn‐forest edge density or corn
                  field proportion. In areas of low corn‐forest edge densities
                  and a low corn field proportion, raccoons showed stronger
                  selection for corn fields when few conspecifics were present.
                  At high conspecific densities, the selection of corn fields
                  was stronger in areas with high corn‐forest edge densities and
                  a low corn field proportion. For striped skunks, we did not
                  detect any synergistic effect of density‐dependence and
                  functional responses. Unlike raccoons, striped skunks
                  displayed a selection that was strongest for agricultural
                  corridors. We show that functional responses in habitat
                  selection can be density‐dependent. In a context of infectious
                  disease dynamics, modeling density‐dependence in functional
                  responses increases the ability to predict spatio‐temporal
                  variations in the distribution of reservoir species and thus,
                  to delineate areas at high animal densities where the risk of
                  disease outbreaks is relatively high. For example, the
                  omission of density‐dependence in functional responses
                  underestimated the relative probability of raccoon occurrence
                  in corn fields, while overestimating the relative probability
                  of occurrence in anthropogenic areas and wetlands. Our study
                  underscores the relevance of considering the complexity of
                  habitat selection by all hosts of a zoonosis. Cost‐effective
                  control and prevention programs used to limit disease spread
                  can benefit from accounting for density‐dependent functional
                  responses of a multi‐host disease system.},

  abstract     = {Author(s): Brown, Jason L.; Carnaval, Ana C. | Abstract: Being
                  snapshots in time, species ranges may fall short of
                  representing all of the geographic or environmental space that
                  they are able to occupy. This has important implications for
                  niche studies yet most comparative studies overlook the
                  transient nature of species distributions and assume that they
                  are at equilibrium. We review the methods most widely used for
                  niche comparisons today and suggest a modified framework to
                  describe and compare niches based on snapshot species range
                  data. First, we introduce a new environmental space-based
                  Niche Equivalence Statistic to test niche similarity between
                  two species, which explicitly incorporates the spatial
                  distribution of environments and their availability into
                  statistical tests. We also introduce a new Background
                  Statistic to measure the ability of this Niche Equivalence
                  Statistic to detect differences based on the available
                  environmental-space. These metrics enable fair comparisons
                  between different geographies when the ranges of species are
                  out of equilibrium. Based on distinct parameterizations of the
                  new Equivalence and Background statistics, we then propose a
                  Niche Divergence Test and a Niche Overlap Test, which allow
                  assessment of whether differences between species emerge from
                  true niche divergences. These methods are implemented in a new
                  R package, ‘humboldt’ and applied to simulated species with
                  pre-defined niches. The new methods improve accuracy of niche
                  similarity and associated tests – consistently outperforming
                  other tests. We show that the quantification of niche
                  similarity should be performed only in environmental space,
                  which is less sensitive than geographic space to the spatial
                  abundance of key environmental variables. Further, our methods
                  characterize the relationships between non-analogous and
                  analogous climates in the species’ distributions, something
                  not available previously. These improvements allow assessment
                  of whether the different environmental spaces occupied by two
                  taxa emerge from true niche evolution, as opposed to
                  differences in life history and biological interactors, or
                  differences in the variety and configuration of environments
                  accessible to them.},

                  J.; Hortal, Joaquin | Abstract: Species are the currency of
                  most biodiversity studies. However, many shortfalls and biases
                  remain in our biodiversity estimates, preventing a
                  comprehensive understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes
                  that have shaped the biodiversity currently available on
                  Earth. Biased biodiversity estimates also jeopardize the
                  effective implementation of data-driven conservation
                  strategies, ultimately leading to biodiversity loss. Here, we
                  delve into the concept of the Latitudinal Taxonomy Gradient
                  (LTG) and show how this new idea provides an interesting
                  conceptual link between the Linnean (i.e., our ignorance of
                  how many species there are on Earth), Darwinian (i.e., our
                  ignorance of species evolutionary relationships), and
                  Wallacean (i.e., our ignorance on species distribution)
                  shortfalls. More specifically, we contribute to an improved
                  understanding of LTGs and establish the basis for the
                  development of new methods that allow us to: (i) better
                  account for the integration between different shortfalls and,
                  (ii) estimate how these interactions may affect our
                  understanding about the evolutionary components of richness
                  gradients at macroecological scales.},

                  computing, the environmental costs of ubiquitous computing in
                  modern life are obscured by the sheer complexity of
                  infrastructures and supply chains involved in even the
                  simplest of digital transactions. How does computation
                  contribute to the warming of the planet? As information
                  technology (IT) capacity demands continue to trend upward,
                  what are some of the ecological obstacles that must be
                  overcome to accommodate an ever-expanding, carbon-hungry
                  Cloud? How do these material impacts play out in everyday
                  life, behind the scenes, where servers, fiber optic cables,
                  and technicians facilitate cloud services? This case study
                  draws on firsthand ethnographic research in data
                  centers—sprawling libraries of computer servers that
                  facilitate everything from email to commerce—to identify some
                  of the far-reaching and tangled environmental impacts of
                  computation and data-storage infrastructures. It surveys a
                  range of empirical accounts of server technicians to
                  illustrate on-the-ground examples of material and ecological
                  factors that permeate everyday life in the Cloud. These
                  examples include air conditioning and thermal management,
                  water cycling, and the disposal of e-waste. By attending to
                  the culture of workplace practice and the behaviors and
                  training of technicians in data centers, this case study
                  reveals that the Cloud is not fully automated, nor is it
                  hyperrational; emotion, instinct, and human judgment are
                  enlisted to keep servers running. This case study closes with
                  a speculative vignette that scales up from various local
                  impacts to a planetary framework, sketching some of the
                  particular ways that computation contributes to climate change

                  should favor specialists because there are tradeoffs limiting
                  the fitness of generalists in any of the alternative hosts or
                  because evolution proceeds faster with narrower niches. Here
                  we review experiments showing that virus adaptation to a
                  specific host is often coupled with fitness losses in
                  alternative ones. In most instances, mutations beneficial in
                  one host are detrimental in another. This antagonistic
                  pleiotropy should limit the range of adaptation and promote
                  the evolution of specialization. However, when hosts fluctuate
                  in time or space, selective pressures are different and
                  generalist viruses may evolve as well.},

               Peoples, this book argues that indigenous peoples have inherent
               and inalienable rights relating to the collection, ownership and
               application of data about them, and about their lifeways and
               territories. As the first book to focus on indigenous data
               sovereignty, it asks: what does data sovereignty mean for
               indigenous peoples, and how is it being used in their pursuit of
               self-determination? The varied group of mostly indigenous
               contributors theorise and conceptualise this fast-emerging field
               and present case studies that illustrate the challenges and
               opportunities involved. These range from indigenous communities
               grappling with issues of identity, governance and development, to
               national governments and NGOs seeking to formulate a response to
               indigenous demands for data ownership. While the book is focused

                  Mendelian genetics, they believe more strongly that racial
                  inequality is genetically determined. In contrast, studies
                  tentatively suggest that if students learn about the
                  complexity of genomics and race it can reduce this same
                  belief. In this article, we investigate for the first time how
                  different types of genetics instruction interact to affect
                  three different conceptions of race that influence how
                  students make sense of racial inequality: (a) genetic
                  essentialism, (b) racial colorblindness, and (c) social
                  constructionism. Through a pre-registered cluster-randomized
                  trial (N = 1063 biology students in N = 6 states), we show
                  that the ideal instructional sequence to reduce essentialism,
                  avoid colorblindness, and increase constructionism is to
                  introduce students to the models of Mendelian genetics and
                  then move beyond these models and highlight their limitations
                  using insights from genomics that refute racist assumptions.
                  This work demonstrates that a genetics education that explores
                  simple and complex forms of inheritance in the right order and
                  for the right purpose can mitigate racial prejudice.}

                  segregation policies have left an indelible impact on urban
                  environments, greenspaces, and wildlife communities, creating

                  species richness) vary by Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)

                  reptilia observations collected between 2000 and 2020, for 145
                  Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States. After

                  significant differences in sampling density across HOLC grade

                  areas previously redlined. Estimated completeness of

                  plants. Expected richness only varied by HOLC grade for birds.
                  Our findings highlight how differences in biodiversity
                  sampling may not translate to differences in expected species
                  richness patterns, and suggest that applying insights obtained
                  from certain taxonomic groups and extrapolating to multiple
                  others may not be appropriate. Urban wildlife communities are
                  not well-documented despite the explosion of digital
                  information, and what is documented is known to be biased
                  along a housing segregation typology for some taxon. These
                  findings add evidence to suggest long-lasting effects of
                  legacies of segregation on the natural world.},

                  Earth yet are seldom included or realistically represented in
                  studies of food web ecology. As ecosystems continue to change
                  in response to natural and anthropogenic pressures, it is
                  important now more than ever to include parasites to improve
                  our understanding of their role, now and in the future. A
                  large-scale biodiversity survey of the coastal marine
                  ecosystem of Otago, New Zealand, provided a unique opportunity
                  to assess what contribution parasitological studies can make
                  toward revealing trophic interactions between species when
                  creating food webs. Here, we created 4 increasingly complex
                  food web depictions of Otago and compared network properties
                  between them to assess changes with each addition of new types
                  of data (first excluding and then including parasite species).
                  We also assessed how parasites influence the functioning of
                  Otago’s food web by simulating extinction scenarios for each
                  web, estimating their robustness to biodiversity loss. The
                  inclusion of parasites altered food web structure, such as
                  decreasing connectance and increasing path length, modularity
                  and species clustering. In both extinction scenarios,
                  including parasites resulted in a lower robustness of the food
                  webs to biodiversity loss. Our results suggest that neglecting
                  parasite taxa in food web studies may lead to inappropriate
                  estimates of ecosystem structure and functioning and possibly
                  an overestimation of an ecosystem’s resilience to change.
                  Above all, we reveal the huge potential of parasitological
                  studies to advance our understanding of predator-prey

                  recent years; approximately 60\% of these emerging diseases
                  are of zoonotic origin, and of those, around 70\% were
                  identified to start with wild animals. To better understand
                  the impacts of zoonotic diseases on wildlife, there is a need
                  to identify the distribution and impact of zoonotic pathogens
                  in wildlife, particular those species with threatened
                  populations. To investigate this question, we constructed a
                  zoonotic disease database identifying wildlife hosts for each
                  bacterial zoonotic disease and recorded clinical signs of
                  disease for each host-pathogen relationship if found. Species
                  of least concern were found to have a significantly higher
                  prevalence and richness of zoonotic bacterial diseases (n=
                  0.0608, x2 = 5.898, p=0.01516). The taxonomic level Order was
                  found to be the best predictor for pathogen richness, and the
                  Artiodactyla and Carnivora contain a significantly higher
                  pathogen richness than other vertebrate Orders. Species with
                  the greatest pathogen richness include the wild boar (Sus
                  scrofa, n=66), Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor, n=16) and the
                  red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n=41). Our results indicate bacterial
                  zoonoses are not likely to be a driving factor of species
                  population declines, and future zoonotic disease surveillance
                  efforts should target species in the Artiodactyla and
                  Carnivora families. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) in particular
                  may be a good candidate for zoonotic disease monitoring due to
                  its high pathogen richness, wide range, and large population.
                  Understanding the impacts and distribution of bacterial
                  zoonoses in wildlife populations can help in planning for

  abstract     = {Urbanization rapidly changes landscape structure worldwide,
                  thereby enlarging the human-wildlife interface. The emerging
                  urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and
                  distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by
                  shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife.
                  However, little is known about the role of urban structures as
                  proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management,
                  especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of
                  landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease
                  prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and
                  2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red
                  fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The
                  directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a
                  virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host
                  mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information
                  about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative),
                  sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state
                  laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban
                  landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g. richness) and shares
                  of green and grey infrastructures at different spatial
                  resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence
                  we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial
                  distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived
                  at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing
                  landscape structures effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to
                  be seropositive decreased by 66\% (0.6 to 0.2) with an
                  increasing share of grey infrastructure (40 \% to 80 \%),
                  suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban
                  areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g. less foxes or
                  raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in
                  strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed
                  patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to
                  water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV
                  transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control
                  actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife
                  interactions should focus on such areas. The possible
                  underlying mechanisms may be increased isolation, the absence
                  of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing
                  the ability of CDV to persist without a host.},

                  within species to differences between populations,
                  communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult
                  to realize in great part because of the complexity of
                  biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of
                  theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other
                  theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic
                  diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial
                  stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to
                  consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to
                  ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require
                  theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to
                  reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have
                  solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic
                  to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution
                  are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty.
                  Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and
                  probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich
                  knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent
                  complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability
                  to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and
                  explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge
                  base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

                  of various organisms can complement this trophic view. The
                  combination of traits and food web positions are studied here
                  on a large food web database. The aim is a better description

                  identification of the most important keystone species. This
                  may contribute to develop better ecological indicators (e.g.,
                  keystoneness) and help in the interpretation of food web
                  models. We use food web data from the Ecopath with Ecosim
                  (EwE) database for 92 aquatic ecosystems. We quantify the
                  network position of organisms by 18 topological indices
                  (measuring centrality, hierarchy, and redundancy) and consider
                  their three, categorical traits (e.g., for mobility: sessile,
                  drifter, limited mobility, and mobile). Relationships are
                  revealed by multivariate analysis. We found that topological
                  indices belong to six different categories and some of them
                  nicely separate various trait categories. For example, benthic
                  organisms are richly connected and mobile organisms occupy
                  higher food web positions.}

                  of the awareness of the OH concept in Colombia and other
                  countries in the Latin American Region. In order to explore

                  health, environmental health sectors, and to describe the
                  perception, knowledge, and barriers on OH in Colombia and
                  other countries of Latin America, an online
                  questionnaire-based survey was distributed among key
                  professionals representing the three OH pillars (August
                  2018-August 2020). Overall, 76 key respondents from 13
                  countries (Colombia, México, Chile, Brazil, Argentina,
                  Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Perú, Guatemala, Nicaragua
                  Uruguay, and Venezuela) completed the questionnaire.
                  Respondents worked in institutions of animal (59\%), public
                  (20\%), human (7\%), and environmental health (7\%); they
                  mainly belonged to higher academic institutions (59\%),
                  followed by ministries (11\%), and research organizations
                  (9\%). Most participants (92\%) were familiar with the OH term
                  and 68\% were aware of the formal cooperation among sectors in
                  their countries, mostly on zoonoses; in 46\% of the cases,
                  such connections were established in the last 5 years. The
                  main reported limiting factors to intersectorality were the
                  lack of commitment of policy-makers, resources, and budget for
                  OH (38\%) and the "siloed approach" of sectors and disciplines
                  (34\%). Respondents ranked a median score of 3.0 (1-5 scoring)
                  in how good OH activities are implemented in their countries,
                  and a median score of 2.0 in the citizen awareness on OH as
                  regards their countries. The most important OH issues were
                  identified in vector-borne diseases, rabies, wrong and/or
                  improper use of antimicrobials, emerging viral diseases,
                  food-borne diseases, neglected parasitic diseases,
                  deforestation, and ecosystem fragmentation. Although there is
                  a high-perceived importance on conjoint cooperation, OH
                  implementation, and operationalization remain weak, and the
                  environmental component is not well-integrated. We consider
                  that integration and implementation of the OH Approach can
                  support countries to improve their health policies and health
                  governance as well as to advocate the social, economic, and

                  interest, each spanning 100 × 100 km2, located in Siberia,

  abstract     = {If the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines had been more
                  equitable across the world, it would have prevented three
                  million infections and 1.3 million people who lost their lives
                  would still be alive. This stark finding should convince
                  political leaders that inequitable access to scientific
                  benefits in the face of global health crises violates human
                  rights. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic humanity faces,
                  and even today is not the only epidemic that requires
                  governments to see scientific progress as a fundamental human
                  right.In April 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO)
                  declared an end to COVID-19 as a global public health
                  emergency but stressed that the difficult work of recovering
                  from COVID-19 and preparing for future pandemics is just
                  beginning. This work – termed “pandemic prevention,
                  preparedness, and response” (PPPR) – is unfolding through a
                  record number of international negotiations on global health
                  issues. In September 2023, the United Nations General Assembly
                  (UNGA) held three high-level meetings on health: one on
                  tuberculosis (TB), one on universal health coverage (UHC), and
                  one on PPPR. Concurrently, WHO member states are negotiating a
                  legally binding Pandemic Accord and revising the International
                  Health Regulations. For the first time in these fora,
                  stakeholders are invoking the right of everyone to enjoy the
                  benefits of scientific progress and its applications

                  developed in the past decade, increasing our ability to
                  accurately model nonlinear and nonadditive response surfaces.
                  This has improved performance for inferential tasks such as
                  estimating average treatment effects in situations where
                  standard parametric models may not fit the data well. These
                  methods have also shown promise for the related task of
                  identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. However, the
                  estimation of both overall and heterogeneous treatment effects
                  can be hampered when data are structured within groups if we
                  fail to correctly model the dependence between observations.
                  Most machine learning methods do not readily accommodate such
                  structure. This paper introduces a new algorithm, stan4bart,
                  that combines the flexibility of Bayesian Additive Regression
                  Trees (BART) for fitting nonlinear response surfaces with the
                  computational and statistical efficiencies of using Stan for
                  the parametric components of the model. We demonstrate how
                  stan4bart can be used to estimate average, subgroup, and
                  individual-level treatment effects with stronger performance
                  than other flexible approaches that ignore the multilevel
                  structure of the data as well as multilevel approaches that
                  have strict parametric forms.},

                  It is frequently moved from developed countries to developing
                  countries where it is dismantled for valuable metals in
                  informal settings, resulting in significant human exposure to
                  toxic substances. E-waste is a major concern in Africa, with
                  large sites in Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is
                  dismantled under unsafe conditions. However, as in many
                  developing countries, used electronic and electrical devices
                  are imported in large quantities because they are in great
                  demand and are less expensive than new ones. Many of these
                  used products are irreparable and are discarded with other
                  solid waste to local landfills. These items are then often
                  scavenged for the purpose of extracting valuable metals by
                  heating and burning, incubating in acids and other methods.
                  These activities pose significant health risks to workers and
                  residents in communities near recycling sites. E-waste burning
                  and dismantling activities are frequently undertaken at
                  e-waste sites, often in or near homes. As a result, children
                  and people living in the surrounding areas are exposed, even
                  if they are not directly involved in the recycling. While

                  especially when a novel subtype emerges from the avian
                  population to cause severe outbreaks in humans. Zoonotic
                  viruses arise from the animal population as a result of
                  mutations and reassortments, giving rise to novel strains with
                  the capability to evade the host species barrier and cause
                  human infections. Despite progress in understanding
                  interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, we are no
                  closer to predicting zoonotic strains that can lead to an
                  outbreak. We have previously discovered distinct host tropism
                  protein signatures of avian, human and zoonotic influenza
                  strains obtained from host tropism predictions on individual
                  protein sequences. Here, we apply machine learning approaches
                  on the signatures to build a computational model capable of
                  predicting zoonotic strains. The zoonotic strain prediction
                  model can classify avian, human or zoonotic strains with high
                  accuracy, as well as providing an estimated zoonotic risk.
                  This would therefore allow us to quickly determine if an
                  influenza virus strain has the potential to be zoonotic using
                  only protein sequences. The swift identification of potential
                  zoonotic strains in the animal population using the zoonotic
                  strain prediction model could provide us with an early
                  indication of an imminent influenza outbreak.},

                  machine learning tools. However, compiling the appropriate
                  training data set for real-world classification problems is
                  challenging because collecting the right amount of data for
                  each class is often difficult or even impossible. In such
                  cases, we can easily face the problem of imbalanced learning.
                  There are many methods in the literature for solving the
                  imbalanced learning problem, so it has become a serious
                  question how to compare the performance of the imbalanced
                  learning methods. Inadequate validation techniques can provide
                  misleading results (e.g., due to data shift), which leads to
                  the development of methods designed for imbalanced data sets,
                  such as stratified cross-validation (SCV) and distribution
                  optimally balanced SCV (DOB-SCV). Previous studies have shown
                  that higher classification performance scores (AUC) can be
                  achieved on imbalanced data sets using DOB-SCV instead of SCV.
                  We investigated the effect of the oversamplers on this
                  difference. The study was conducted on 420 data sets,
                  involving several sampling methods and the DTree, kNN, SVM,
                  and MLP classifiers. We point out that DOB-SCV often provides
                  a little higher F1 and AUC values for classification combined
                  with sampling. However, the results also prove that the
                  selection of the sampler-classifier pair is more important for
                  the classification performance than the choice between the
                  DOB-SCV and the SCV techniques.},

                  the country, for the presence of coronaviruses. We found CoVs
                  in 35 (11\%) of the tested bats-in three insectivorous bat
                  species and five fruit bat species that were mostly captured
                  close to human habitat. Positivity rates varied from 5.7\% to
                  100\%, depending on bat species. A wide diversity of alpha and
                  beta coronaviruses was found across the country, including
                  three sequences belonging to SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs subgenera
                  known to harbor highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Our
                  findings suggest that CoVs are widely spread in West Africa
                  and their circulation should be assessed to evaluate the risk
                  of exposure of potential zoonotic CoVs to humans.},

                  such as dengue, West Nile fever, chikungunya, and Zika fever,
                  has intensified research on these and other arbovirus diseases
                  worldwide. Investigating the unique mode of vector-borne
                  transmission requires a clear understanding of the roles of
                  vertebrates. One major obstacle to this understanding is the
                  ambiguity of the arbovirus definition originally established
                  by the World Health Organization. The paucity of pertinent
                  information on arbovirus transmission at the time contributed
                  to the notion that vertebrates played the role of reservoir in
                  the arbovirus transmission cycle. Because this notion is a
                  salient feature of the arbovirus definition, it is important
                  to reexamine its validity. This review addresses controversial
                  issues concerning vertebrate reservoirs and their role in

                  ecological and evolutionary patterns among species, may help
                  at targeting reservoirs of zoonotic diseases particularly in
                  countries presenting high biodiversity. Here, we developed a
                  simple method to target rodent reservoirs using published
                  studies screening microparasite infections. METHODS: We
                  compiled surveys of microparasites investigated in rodents
                  trapped in Thailand. The data comprise a total of 17,358
                  rodents from 18 species that have been investigated for a
                  total of 10 microparasites (viruses, bacteria and protozoans).
                  We used residual variation of microparasite richness
                  controlled for both rodent sample size and pathogens'
                  screening effort to identify major rodent reservoirs and
                  potential risky habitats. RESULTS: Microparasite species
                  richness was positively related to rodent sample size and
                  pathogens' screening effort. The investigation of the residual
                  variations of microparasite species richness showed that
                  several rodent species harboured more pathogens than expected
                  by the regression model. Similarly, higher pathogen richness
                  than expected was observed in rodents living in non-flooded
                  lands, forests and paddy fields. CONCLUSION: Our results
                  suggest to target some rodent species that are not commonly
                  investigated for pathogen screening or surveillance such as R.
                  adamanensis or B. savilei, and that non-flooded lands and
                  forests should be more taken into caution, whereas much

                  production, and needing more animals to feed it. Emerging
                  infectious diseases are increasing, causing losses in both
                  human and animal lives, as well as large costs to society.
                  Many factors are contributing to disease emergence, including
                  climate change, globalization and urbanization, and most of
                  these factors are to some extent caused by humans. Pathogens
                  may be more or less prone to emergence in themselves, and
                  rapidly mutating viruses are more common among the emerging
                  pathogens. The climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are
                  likely to be emerging due to climate changes and environmental
                  changes, such as increased irrigation. This review lists the
                  factors within pathogens that make them prone to emergence,
                  and the modes of transmission that are affected. The
                  anthropogenic changes contributing to disease emergence are

                  either increased numbers of susceptible or exposed
                  individuals, or cause increased infectivity. Many actions may
                  have multiple direct or indirect effects, and it may be
                  difficult to assess what the consequences may be. In addition,

                  in science. The present article considers some questionable
                  metascience practices (QMPs) that may threaten scientists’
                  trust in metascience. A QMP is a research practice,
                  assumption, or perspective that has been questioned by several
                  commentators as being potentially problematic for the
                  credibility of metascience and/or the science reform movement.
                  The present article reviews 10 QMPs that relate to criticism,
                  replication, bias, generalization, and the characterization of
                  science. Specifically, the following QMPs are considered: (1)
                  rejecting or ignoring self-criticism; (2) a fast ‘n’ bropen
                  scientific criticism style; (3) overplaying the role of
                  replication in science; (4) assuming a replication rate is
                  “too low” without specifying an “acceptable” rate; (5) an
                  unacknowledged metabias towards explaining the replication
                  crisis in terms of researcher bias; (6) assuming that
                  researcher bias can be reduced; (7) devaluing exploratory
                  results as more “tentative” than confirmatory results; (8)
                  presuming that QRPs are problematic research practices; (9)
                  focusing on knowledge accumulation as an index of scientific
                  progress; and (10) focusing on specific scientific methods. It
                  is stressed that only some metascientists engage in some QMPs
                  some of the time, and that these QMPs may not always be
                  problematic. Research is required to estimate the prevalence
                  and impact of QMPs. In the meantime, QMPs should be viewed as
                  invitations to ask “questions” about how we go about doing
                  metascience rather than as grounds for mistrusting the
                  credibility of metascience.},

                  additional time and effort compared to conducting ‘closed’
                  research. However, this additional work is often discussed
                  only in abstract terms, a discourse which ignores the
                  practicalities of how researchers are expected to find the
                  time to engage with these practices in the context of their
                  broader role as multifaceted academics. In the context of a
                  sector that is blighted by stress, burnout, untenable
                  workloads, and hyper-competitive pressures to produce, there
                  is a clear danger that additional expectations to engage in
                  open practices add to the workload burden and increase
                  pressure on academics even further. In this article, the
                  theories of academic capitalism and workload creep are used to
                  explore how workload models currently exploit researchers by
                  mismeasuring academic labour. The specific increase in
                  workload resulting from open practices and associated
                  administration is then outlined, including via the cumulative
                  effects of administrative burden. It is argued that there is a
                  high chance that without intervention, increased expectations
                  to engage in open research practices may lead to unacceptable
                  increases in demands on academics. Finally, the individual and
                  systematic responsibilities to mitigate this are discussed.},

                  which focus on the individual academic researcher instead of

                  repositories, such as the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research
                  Network (http://www.tern.org.au) and the Atlas of Living
                  Australia (ALA: http://www.ala.org.au), the Australian node of
                  the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF:
                  http://www.gbif.org). It is hoped that the lessons learnt from

                  conceived to study, report, and manage biodiversity change.
                  The EBV netCDF structure was developed in order to support
                  publication and interoperability of biodiversity data. This
                  standard is based on the Network Common Data Format (netCDF).
                  Additionally, it follows the Climate and Forecast Conventions
                  (CF, version 1.8) and the Attribute Convention for Data
                  Discovery (ACDD, version 1.3). The standard allows several
                  datacubes per netCDF file (see Fig. 1). These cubes have four
                  dimensions: longitude, latitude, time and entity, whereby the
                  last dimension can, for example, encompass different species
                  or groups of species, ecosystem types or other aspects. The
                  usage of hierarchical groups enables the coexistence of
                  multiple EBV cubes (see Fig. 2). The first level (netCDF
                  group) are scenarios, e.g., the modelling for different Shared
                  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. The second level
                  (netCDF group) are metrics, e.g., the percentage of protected
                  area per pixel and its proportional loss over a certain time
                  span per pixel. All metrics are repeated per scenario, if any
                  are present. The result is a rather complex raster dataset
                  (see example dataset in Fig. 3). This is where the ebvcube R
                  package comes into play. This R package enables scientists to
                  create their own netCDFs in the EBV cube standard. Its
                  functionality covers the creation, opening/reading and
                  visualizing the EBV netCDFs. The ebvcube package is part of
                  the overall EBV infrastructure and works together with the EBV
                  Data Portal. Users can work with the downloaded EBV netCDFs or
                  upload their own EBV netCDFs to the portal. Generally, the
                  package aims to condense the output for the users and assist
                  in the understanding of the file structure to overcome the
                  complexity. The output is reduced to the necessary
                  information, e.g., not displaying coordinate variables or any
                  technical attributes. Moreover, functionality for a quick data
                  exploration is implemented.},

                  organic carbon (SOC) stock variation are necessary both for
                  our scientific understanding of the terrestrial carbon balance
                  and to support policies that intend to promote carbon storage
                  in soils to mitigate climate change. In recent years, complex
                  statistical and algorithmic tools from the field of machine
                  learning have become popular for modelling and mapping SOC
                  stocks over large areas. In this paper, we report on the
                  development of a statistical method for interpreting complex
                  models, which we implemented for the study of SOC stock
                  variation. We fitted a random forest machine learning model
                  with 2206 measurements of SOC stocks for the 0–50 cm depth
                  interval from mainland France and used a set of environmental
                  covariates as explanatory variables. We introduce Shapley
                  values, a method from coalitional game theory, and use them to
                  understand how environmental factors influence SOC stock
                  prediction: what is the functional form of the association in
                  the model between SOC stocks and environmental covariates, and
                  how does the covariate importance vary locally from one
                  location to another and between carbon-landscape zones?
                  Results were validated both in light of the existing and
                  well-described soil processes mediating soil carbon storage
                  and with regards to previous studies in the same area. We
                  found that vegetation and topography were overall the most
                  important drivers of SOC stock variation in mainland France
                  but that the set of most important covariates varied greatly
                  among locations and carbon-landscape zones. In two spatial
                  locations with equivalent SOC stocks, there was nearly an
                  opposite pattern in the individual covariate contribution that
                  yielded the prediction – in one case climate variables
                  contributed positively, whereas in the second case climate
                  variables contributed negatively – and this effect was
                  mitigated by land use. We demonstrate that Shapley values are
                  a methodological development that yield useful insights into
                  the importance of factors controlling SOC stock variation in
                  space. This may provide valuable information to understand
                  whether complex empirical models are predicting a property of
                  interest for the right reasons and to formulate hypotheses on
                  the mechanisms driving the carbon sequestration potential of a

               a novel conformity score, which we explicitly demonstrate to be

               underlying principle is potentially far more general. Experiments

                  scientific data is useful, system developers need to
                  understand what scientists and other intended users do as well
                  as the attitudes and beliefs that shape their behaviours. This
                  paper introduces personas — detailed descriptions of an
                  “archetypical user of a system” — as an approach for capturing
                  and sharing knowledge about potential system users. Setting:
                  Personas were developed to support development of the
                  ‘DataONE’ (Data Observation Network for Earth) project, which
                  has developed and deployed a sustainable long-term data
                  preservation and access network to ensure the preservation and
                  access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national
                  environmental and biological science data
                  (https://www.dataone.org/what-dataone) (Michener et al. 2012).
                  Methods: Personas for DataONE were developed based on data
                  from surveys and interviews done by members of DataONE working
                  groups along with sources such as usage scenarios for DataONE
                  and the Data Conservancy project and the Purdue Data Curation
                  Profiles (Witt et al. 2009). Results: A total of 11 personas
                  were developed: five for various kinds of research scientists
                  (e.g., at different career stages and using different types of
                  data); a science data librarian; and five for secondary roles.
                  Conclusion: Personas were found to be useful for helping
                  developers and other project members to understand users and
                  their needs. The developed DataONE personas may be useful for
                  others trying to develop systems or programs for scientists
                  involved in data sharing.},

                  new modes of production involving cooperation and
                  collaboration amongst peers (peer-production). In contrast
                  with traditional models of production oriented towards the
                  maximization of profits, these alternative modes of production
                  are, more often than not, oriented towards the maximization of
                  the common good. To ensure that content will always remain
                  available to the public, the output of production is often
                  released under a specific regime that prevents anyone from
                  subsequently turning it into a commodity (the regime of
                  information commons). While this might reduce the likelihood
                  of commodification, information commons can nonetheless be
                  exploited by the market economy. Indeed, since they have been
                  made available for use by anyone, large online service
                  providers can indirectly benefit from the commons by capturing
                  the value derived from it. While this is not a problem per se,
                  problems arise when the exploitation of the commons by one
                  agent is likely to preclude others from doing the same—often
                  as a result of commodification. This is especially true in the
                  context of cloud computing, where the content holder has
                  become as powerful as, if not more powerful than the copyright
                  owner. Nowadays, regardless of their legal status, information
                  commons are increasingly controlled by large corporations who
                  can precisely define the manner in which they can be used or
                  accessed. Digital communities need to be aware of these risks.
                  This Article proposes a theoretical and normative exploration
                  of these issues based on an analysis of recent trends in cloud
                  computing. It argues that, in order to reduce the likelihood
                  of commodification but still benefit from the advantages
                  offered by cloud computing, digital communities should rely on
                  decentralized platforms based on peer-to-peer architectures,
                  thereby escaping from the centralized control of large service
                  providers while nonetheless preserving the autonomy of the

               current data to investigate the variation of networks across
               space. However, issues remain in how to represent the spatial
               variability and uncertainty of species interactions, especially
               for large-scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic
               framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian mammal
               metaweb and species occurrences from global databases. We
               investigated how our approach can be used to represent the
               variability of networks and communities between ecoregions in
               Canada. Species richness and interactions followed a similar
               latitudinal gradient across ecoregions but simultaneously
               identified contrasting diversity hotspots. Network motifs
               revealed additional areas of variation in network structure
               compared to species richness and number of links. Our method
               offers the potential to bring global predictions down to a more
               actionable local scale, and increases the diversity of ecological
               networks that can be projected in space.},

  abstract  = {1. Individual animals can attempt to prevent or mitigate parasite
               risks by altering their behaviour or space use. Behavioural
               change in response to the presence of parasites in the
               environment generates what is known as the “landscape of disgust”
               (analogous to the predator-induced “landscape of fear”). Using a
               spatial description of cues that indicate parasite risk, and
               characterizing individual responses to those cues, can allow
               researchers to quantify and interpret how hosts navigate the
               landscape of disgust. The landscape of disgust framework could
               facilitate much needed research on the ecological impacts of
               parasitism, advancing the fields of disease, spatial, and
               behavioural ecology. 2. Despite the potential for improving our
               inference of host-parasite dynamics, three key limitations of the
               landscape of disgust restrict the potential insight that can be
               gained from current research. First, many host-parasite systems
               will not be appropriate for invoking the landscape of disgust
               framework. Second, existing research has primarily focused on
               immediate choices made by hosts on small scales, limiting
               predictive power, generalizability, and the value of the insight
               obtained from the landscape of disgust framework. Finally,
               relevant ecological and evolutionary theory has not been
               integrated into the framework, challenging our ability to
               interpret and understand the application of the landscape of
               disgust within the context of most host-parasite systems. 3. In
               this review, we explore the specific requirements for
               implementing a landscape of disgust framework in empirical
               systems. We propose an expansion to the landscape of disgust

                  multiple meanings associated with them. While this could lead
                  to confusion, discord, or even tests that violate core
                  assumptions of a given theory or model, this ambiguity could
                  also be a feature that allows for new knowledge creation
                  through the interconnected nature of concepts. We approached
                  this debate from a quantitative perspective, and investigated
                  the cost of ambiguity related to definitions of ecological
                  units in ecology related to the general term “community.” We
                  did a meta-analysis of tests associated with two bodies of
                  literature, Hubbell’s unified neutral theory of biodiversity
                  and biogeography and Diamond’s assembly rules, that rely on a
                  specific ecological unit that assumes that species are
                  existing within a local area and that they have overlapping
                  resource needs. We predicted that if ambiguous terminology is
                  widespread, then researchers will have tested them with many
                  different ecological units, that in addition some of these
                  ecological units will violate the core assumptions of the
                  theory, and finally that the overall level of support for a
                  theory will be stronger if appropriate ecological units were
                  used. We found that indeed multiple different ecological units
                  were used in the literature to test both theories, with 65
                  percent appropriate ecological units for neutral theory tests,
                  and only 6 percent for assembly rule tests. Finally, there was
                  some evidence that the support for a theory depended on
                  whether appropriate ecological units were used for neutral

               identifiable as the likelihood has a rotational symmetry. This
               gives rise to complicated posterior distributions with continuous
               subspaces of equal density and thus hinders efficiency of
               inference as well as interpretation of obtained parameters. In
               particular, posterior averages over factor loadings become
               meaningless and only model predictions are unambiguous. Here, we
               propose a parameterization based on Householder transformations,
               which remove the rotational symmetry of the posterior.
               Furthermore, by relying on results from random matrix theory, we
               establish the parameter distribution which leaves the model
               unchanged compared to the original rotationally symmetric
               formulation. In particular, we avoid the need to compute the
               Jacobian determinant of the parameter transformation. This allows
               us to efficiently implement probabilistic PCA in a rotation
               invariant fashion in any state of the art toolbox. Here, we

  abstract  = {Ecosystems are composed of networks of interacting species. These
               interactions allow communities of species to persist through time
               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

  abstract = {Rabies is a major issue for human and animal health in the Arctic,
              yet little is known about its epidemiology. In particular, there
              is an ongoing debate regarding how Arctic rabies persists in its
              primary reservoir host, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), which
              exists in the ecosystem at very low population densities. To shed
              light on the mechanisms of rabies persistence in the Arctic, we
              built a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR)
              epidemiological model of rabies virus transmission in an Arctic
              fox population interacting with red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), a
              rabies host that is increasingly present in the Arctic. The model
              suggests that rabies cannot be maintained in resource-poor areas
              of the Arctic, characterized by low Arctic fox density, even in
              the presence of continuous reintroduction of the virus by infected
              Arctic foxes from neighbouring regions. However, in populations of
              relatively high Arctic fox density, rabies persists under
              conditions of higher transmission rate, prolonged infectious
              period and for a broad range of incubation periods. Introducing
              the strong cyclical dynamics of Arctic prey availability makes
              simulated rabies outbreaks less regular but more intense, with an
              onset that does not neatly track peaks in Arctic fox density.
              Finally, interaction between Arctic and red foxes increases the
              frequency and/or the intensity of rabies outbreaks in the Arctic
              fox population. Our work suggests that disruption of prey cycles
              and increasing interactions between Arctic and red foxes due to
              climate change and northern development may significantly change
              the epidemiology of rabies across the Arctic.}

                  levels of confidence in new predictions. Given an error
                  probability e, together with a method that makes a prediction
                  ŷ of a label y, it produces a set of labels, typically
                  containing ŷ, that also contains y with probability 1  e.
                  Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for
                  producing ŷ: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector
                  machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is
                  designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted
                  successively, each one being revealed before the next is
                  predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal
                  prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled
                  independently from the same distribution, then the successive
                  predictions will be right 1  e of the time, even though they
                  are based on an accumulating data set rather than on
                  independent data sets. In addition to the model under which
                  successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line
                  compression models can also use conformal prediction. The
                  widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This

                  conformal prediction and works through several numerical
                  examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is
