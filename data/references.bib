  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global
                  sustainability goals.},

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  investment in gonads and spleen were correlated, showing that

                  studies in immunoecology, was not always a significant
                  indicator of immunocompetence during this period. This last
                  proposition is supported by the lack of correlation between

                  measurements were taken on sclerotized parts of the attachment

                  morphometry within a host species, or between several host
                  species, was assessed using both exploratory analyses
                  (principal component analysis and clustering analysis) and
                  statistical tests. We showed that: (1) for three out of four
                  morphotypes, the global morphometry was significantly
                  different according to host species used, and (2) the

                  Diplodus sargus could reflect an ongoing intra-host speciation
