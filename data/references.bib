  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global

                  informed decisions. Poorly supported management can have
                  detrimental, costly or irreversible impacts on the environment
                  and society. Here, we examine common issues in ecological
                  modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling
                  frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is
                  crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the
                  available data and understanding of ecological structures.
                  Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over
                  parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a
                  lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to
                  predict ecological systems' responses to management.
                  Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of
                  model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a
                  series of critical questions regarding state and control
                  variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the
                  sensitivity and validity of analyses. We also need to improve

                  to better understand the relevancy and adequacy of our models

                  has grown increasingly difficult as state-of-the-art
                  architectures grow more complex. Following the path of
                  traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers
                  have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and
                  fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. Prior works have
                  studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to
                  guide software engineers towards better package maintenance
                  and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of
                  knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems.
                  In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of
                  PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most
                  popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices
                  and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the
                  decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified
                  practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse,
                  including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three
                  challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies
                  between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We
                  substantiate these identified challenges with systematic
                  measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs
                  future directions on optimizing deep learning ecosystems by
                  automated measuring useful attributes and potential attacks,

                  What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer
                  this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques

                  in how researchers collect data and the amount of data being

                  version, and archive data; 3) rapidly publish new data in ways

                  automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time
                  and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages

                  meaning of vulnerability has proved extremely difficult. On
                  the one hand, it is an increasingly formalised term that means
                  something very specific scientifically and methodologically
                  within the climate change institutions. On the other hand,
                  vulnerability is part of a colonial discursive framework of
                  risk. In this article, I show how contestations into the
                  scientific project have not sufficiently worked to address the
                  colonial geographic imaginaries that underlie the discursive
                  framework of vulnerability. I suggest that bringing together
                  the work of critical adaptation studies (CAS) with critical
                  feminist and decolonial scholarship, such as the
                  counternarratives of the Pacific,offers a way to resist the
                  victimising politics of disposability and also rethink

                  neanderthalensis) and the question of whether or not they
                  dispersed into Southern Scandinavia, two contradictory
                  hypotheses can be identified. The first, and also the most
                  widely endorsed, hereafter, hypothesis A, argues primarily
                  that Neanderthals did not occupy regions above 55°N because of
                  1) climatic constraints and 2) dispersal barriers. The second,
                  hypothesis B, argues that they possibly occasionally dispersed
                  above 55°N, but that factors such as 1) research- and/or 2)
                  taphonomic bias are responsible for their archaeological
                  invisibility. Here, we report an evaluation of these competing
                  hypotheses. To this end, we reconstruct the environment for
                  the time period and region of interest (the Last Interglacial
                  Complex and Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia), based
                  on three lines of evidence: palaeoenvironmental reconstruction
                  combined with a novel habitat modelling approach, a review of
                  relevant archaeological localities, and a discussion of the
                  possible impacts of both research biases and the taphonomic
                  effects on the archaeological data. We focus particularly on
                  the climatic and geological explanatory factors relevant to
                  the two hypotheses. Our results are inconsistent with the
                  claim that climatic constraint and/or a lack of suitable
                  habitats can fully explain the absence of Neanderthals in
                  Southern Scandinavia during the Eemian Interglacial and Early
                  Weichselian Glaciation. We do, however, find evidence that a
                  geographic barrier may have impeded northerly migrations
                  during the Eemian. The evidence reviewed here suggests that
                  both research bias and taphonomy – consistent with hypothesis
                  B – could account for the archaeological invisibility of
                  Neanderthals in Southern Scandinavia, highlighting the need
                  for further strategic survey and/or excavation efforts in the
                  region.},

                  scientific data is useful, system developers need to
                  understand what scientists and other intended users do as well
                  as the attitudes and beliefs that shape their behaviours. This
                  paper introduces personas — detailed descriptions of an
                  “archetypical user of a system” — as an approach for capturing
                  and sharing knowledge about potential system users. Setting:
                  Personas were developed to support development of the
                  ‘DataONE’ (Data Observation Network for Earth) project, which
                  has developed and deployed a sustainable long-term data
                  preservation and access network to ensure the preservation and
                  access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national
                  environmental and biological science data
                  (https://www.dataone.org/what-dataone) (Michener et al. 2012).
                  Methods: Personas for DataONE were developed based on data
                  from surveys and interviews done by members of DataONE working
                  groups along with sources such as usage scenarios for DataONE
                  and the Data Conservancy project and the Purdue Data Curation
                  Profiles (Witt et al. 2009). Results: A total of 11 personas
                  were developed: five for various kinds of research scientists
                  (e.g., at different career stages and using different types of
                  data); a science data librarian; and five for secondary roles.
                  Conclusion: Personas were found to be useful for helping
                  developers and other project members to understand users and
                  their needs. The developed DataONE personas may be useful for

                  and study distributions of species. Many different modeling
                  methods and associated algorithms are used and continue to
                  emerge. It is important to understand how different approaches
                  perform, particularly when applied to species occurrence
                  records that were not gathered in struc­tured surveys (e.g.
                  opportunistic records). This need motivated a large-scale,
                  collaborative effort, published in 2006, that aimed to create
                  objective comparisons of algorithm performance. As a
                  benchmark, and to facilitate future comparisons of approaches,
                  here we publish that dataset: point location records for 226
                  anonymized species from six regions of the world, with
                  accompanying predictor variables in raster (grid) and point
                  formats. A particularly interesting characteristic of this
                  dataset is that independent presence-absence survey data are
                  available for evaluation alongside the presence-only species
                  occurrence data intended for modeling. The dataset is
                  available on Open Science Framework and as an R package and
                  can be used as a benchmark for modeling approaches and for
                  testing new ways to evaluate the accuracy of SDMs.},

                  to address complex environmental issues. While the benefits of
                  team science approaches are clear, researchers often struggle
                  with its implementation, particularly for new team members.
                  The challenges of large projects often weigh on the most
                  vulnerable members of a team: trainees, including
                  undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral
                  researchers. Trainees on big projects have to navigate their
                  role on the team, with learning project policies, procedures,
                  and goals, all while also training in key scientific tasks
                  such as co-authoring papers. To address these challenges, we
                  created and participated in a project-specific, graduate-level
                  team science course. The purposes of this course were to: (1)
                  introduce students to the goals of the project, (2) build
                  trainees' understanding of how big projects operate, and (3)
                  allow trainees to explore how their research interests
                  dovetailed with the overall project. Additionally, trainees
                  received training regarding: (1) diversity, equity \&
                  inclusion, (2) giving and receiving feedback, and (3)
                  effective communication. Onboarding through the team science
                  course cultivated psychological safety and a collaborative
                  student community across disciplines and institutions. Thus,
                  we recommend a team science course for onboarding students to
                  big projects to help students establish the skills necessary
                  for collaborative research. Project-based team science classes
                  can benefit student advancement, enhance the productivity of
                  the project, and accelerate the discovery of solutions to
                  ecological issues by building community, establishing a shared
                  project vocabulary, and building a workforce with
                  collaborative skills to better answer ecological research

                  over Earth's history. Despite-or even spurred by-this growing
                  availability of resources, analytical paleobiology faces
                  deep-rooted obstacles that stem from the need for more
                  equitable access to data and best practices to guide analyses
                  of the fossil record. Recent progress has been accelerated by
                  a collective push toward more collaborative,
                  interdisciplinary, and open science, especially by
                  early-career researchers. Here, we survey four challenges
                  facing analytical paleobiology from an early-career
                  perspective: (1) accounting for biases when interpreting the
                  fossil record; (2) integrating fossil and modern biodiversity

                  data accessibility and equity. We discuss recent efforts to
                  address each challenge, highlight persisting barriers, and
                  identify tools that have advanced analytical work. Given the
                  inherent linkages between these challenges, we encourage
                  discourse across disciplines to find common solutions. We also
                  affirm the need for systemic changes that reevaluate how we

                  documentation in improving research quality and impact.
                  Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive
                  text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic,
                  and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by
                  nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when
                  producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of
                  this tool in research publication is not common, despite its
                  potential to increase research impact and quality. For a
                  single study, the content of such documentation partially
                  overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the
                  scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to
                  minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files
                  related to these contents and optimize their production, we
                  present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of
                  computational notebooks in the research process, including
                  publication. The kit contains the template of a computational
                  notebook integrated into a research project that employs R,
                  Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we
                  show how computational notebooks also foster the
                  implementation of principles of Open Science, such as
                  reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for
                  beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be
                  gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research
                  workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective
                  starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice

                  Here, through a combination of phylogenetic and
                  epidemiological models, we reconstructed the recent
                  transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons

                  domesticated Aedes aegypti was able to capture the seasonality

                  high niche availability associated with the diversity of host
                  plants and dense niche packing due to host partitioning among

                  both host ecological and viral genomic features to predict
                  likely reservoirs of OPVs. We demonstrate that incorporating
                  viral genomic features in addition to host ecological traits
                  enhanced the accuracy of potential OPV host predictions,
                  highlighting the importance of host-virus molecular

                  to understand how environmental variation influences species
                  geographical distribution. SDMs are implemented by several
                  different algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms
                  consistently lose accuracy exactly when they are needed the
                  most, that is with rare species, originating the so‐called
                  rare‐species modelling paradox. Although approaches exist to
                  tackle this problem, most notably by performing and then
                  averaging a number of bivariate models, they are usually
                  computationally intensive and were never shown to apply
                  successfully to the rarest species (i.e. with less than 20
                  geographical occurrences). Here, we present a new algorithm,
                  ENphylo, embedded in the readily‐available R package RRdtn,
                  which couples Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and
                  phylogenetic imputation to model the distribution of rare
                  species. Using the fossil record of 31 species of large
                  mammals that lived during the late Pleistocene as the source
                  data to sample from, we demonstrate ENphylo provides good SDM
                  evaluation scores, with area under the curve and Sørensen
                  Index both consistently above 0.75, True Skills Statistics
                  above 0.4 and Boyce Index above 0.5 in most cases, when just
                  10 fossil occurrences are randomly drawn from their respective
                  fossil records. ENphylo proved significantly more accurate
                  than ENFA and the ensemble of bivariate models using Maxent,
                  Generalized Linear Model and Random Forest algorithms.
                  Intriguingly, we found that randomly drawing as little as 10
                  occurrence data points per species allows ENphylo to perform
                  equally well as Maxent run using the entire fossil record of
                  these same species and data. ENphylo provides a fast and
                  accurate solution to perform species distribution modelling
                  with rare species, which will help predicting their
                  distribution in the light of climate change, and to delineate
                  how rare extinct species reacted to past climatic variation.},

                  distribution of species using occurrence data and
                  environmental variables. While data on species presence are
                  increasingly accessible, the difficulty of confirming real
                  absences in the field often forces researchers to generate
                  them in silico. To this aim, pseudo‐absences are commonly
                  sampled randomly across the study area (i.e. the geographical
                  space). However, this introduces sample location bias (i.e.
                  the sampling is unbalanced towards the most frequent habitats
                  occurring within the geographical space) and favours class
                  overlap (i.e. overlap between environmental conditions
                  associated with species presences and pseudo‐absences) in the
                  training dataset. To mitigate this, we propose an alternative
                  methodology (i.e. the uniform approach) that systematically
                  samples pseudo‐absences within a portion of the environmental
                  space delimited by a kernel‐based filter, which seeks to
                  minimise the number of false absences included in the training
                  dataset. We simulated 50 virtual species and modelled their
                  distribution using training datasets assembled with the
                  presence points of the virtual species and pseudo‐absences
                  collected using the uniform approach and other approaches that
                  randomly sample pseudo‐absences within the geographical space.
                  We compared the predictive performance of habitat suitability
                  models and evaluated the extent of sample location bias and
                  class overlap associated with the different sampling
                  strategies. Results indicated that the uniform approach: (i)
                  effectively reduces sample location bias and class overlap;
                  (ii) provides comparable predictive performance to sampling
                  strategies carried out in the geographical space; and (iii)
                  ensures gathering pseudo‐absences adequately representing the
                  environmental conditions available across the study area. We

                  unknown, especially for multi-trophic interactions. We here
                  collected a large dataset consisting of 2670 observations of
                  tri-trophic interactions among plants, sap-sucking aphids and
                  honeydew-collecting ants on 18 forested islands in the
                  Thousand Island Lake, China. For each island, we constructed
                  an antagonistic plant–aphid and a mutualistic aphid–ant
                  network, and tested how network specialization varied with
                  island area and isolation. We found that both networks
                  exhibited higher specialization on smaller islands, while only
                  aphid–ant networks had increased specialization on more
                  isolated islands. Variations in network specialization among
                  islands was primarily driven by species turnover, which was
                  interlinked across trophic levels as fragmentation increased
                  the specialization of both antagonistic and mutualistic
                  networks through bottom-up effects via plant and aphid
                  communities. These findings reveal that species on small and
                  isolated islands display higher specialization mainly due to
                  effects of fragmentation on species turnover, with behavioural
                  changes causing interaction rewiring playing only a minor
                  role. Our study highlights the significance of adopting a
                  multi-trophic perspective when exploring patterns and
                  processes in structuring ecological networks in fragmented

                  of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based
                  epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels

                  sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater
                  samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical
                  to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting

                  ground-truth climate models and to narrow their geographic
                  sensitivity. To assess the potential role of local knowledge
                  in our quest to understand better climate change and its
                  impacts, we first need to critically review the strengths and
                  weaknesses of local knowledge of climate change and the
                  potential complementarity with scientific knowledge. With this
                  aim, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of
                  published peer-reviewed documents reporting local indicators
                  of climate change (including both local observations of
                  climate change and observed impacts on the biophysical and the
                  social systems). Overall, primary data on the topic are not
                  abundant, the methodological development is incipient, and the
                  geographical extent is unbalanced. On the 98 case studies
                  documented, we recorded the mention of 746 local indicators of
                  climate change, mostly corresponding to local observations of
                  climate change (40\%), but also to observed impacts on the
                  physical (23\%), the biological (19\%), and the socioeconomic
                  (18\%) systems. Our results suggest that, even if local
                  observations of climate change are the most frequently
                  reported type of change, the rich and fine-grained knowledge
                  in relation to impacts on biophysical systems could provide
                  more original contributions to our understanding of climate

                  While the field of explainable ML has expanded in recent
                  years, much of this work has not taken real-world needs into
                  account. A majority of proposed methods are designed with
                  generic explainability goals without well-defined use cases or
                  intended end users and evaluated on simplified tasks,
                  benchmark problems/datasets, or with proxy users (e.g., Amazon
                  Mechanical Turk). We argue that these simplified evaluation
                  settings do not capture the nuances and complexities of
                  real-world applications. As a result, the applicability and
                  effectiveness of this large body of theoretical and
                  methodological work in real-world applications are unclear. In
                  this work, we take steps toward addressing this gap for the
                  domain of public policy. First, we identify the primary use
                  cases of explainable ML within public policy problems. For
                  each use case, we define the end users of explanations and the
                  specific goals the explanations have to fulfill. Finally, we
                  map existing work in explainable ML to these use cases,
                  identify gaps in established capabilities, and propose
                  research directions to fill those gaps to have a practical
                  societal impact through ML. The contribution is (a) a
                  methodology for explainable ML researchers to identify use
                  cases and develop methods targeted at them and (b) using that
                  methodology for the domain of public policy and giving an
                  example for the researchers on developing explainable ML

                  exclusion of plant species by determining which plants receive
                  conspecific pollen. A key question is whether realistic
                  pollinator foraging behavior promotes coexistence or exclusion
                  of plant species. We use a simulation model to understand how
                  pollinator foraging behavior impacts the coexistence dynamics
                  of pollen-limited plants. To determine whether pollinators are
                  likely to provide a biologically important coexistence
                  mechanism, we compare our results to bee foraging data from
                  the literature and from a novel experimental analysis. Model
                  results indicate that strong specialization at the level of
                  individual foraging paths is required to promote coexistence.
                  However, few empirical studies have robustly quantified
                  within-bout specialization. Species-level data suggest that
                  foraging behavior is sufficient to permit pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence in species-poor plant communities and possibly in
                  diverse communities where congeneric plants co-occur. Our
                  experiments using bumblebees show that individual-level
                  specialization does exist, but not at levels sufficient to
                  substantially impact coexistence dynamics. The literature on
                  specialization within natural foraging paths suffers from key
                  limitations, but overall suggests that pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence should be rare in diverse plant communities.},

                  non of science, but prediction means different things to
                  different people in different contexts. I organize and explain
                  this diversity by addressing five questions. What does it mean
                  to predict something? To answer this question, I describe
                  concepts of prediction as prophecy, diagnosis, history,
                  repeatability, and fate. What are we trying to predict? Here,
                  I describe how predictions vary along several axes: general to
                  specific, qualitative to quantitative, relative to absolute,
                  point to range, and continuous to discontinuous. Where do
                  predictions come from? In this case, I focus on deductive
                  versus inductive reasoning. How do we test predictions? The
                  answer here is not straightforward and I discuss various
                  approaches and difficulties. How good are predictions? Not
                  surprisingly, it depends on what is being predicted and how we
                  judge success. Importantly, I do not espouse a “best” way to
                  approach prediction but, rather, I outline its diverse

                  structure, I evaluate here how introduced parasites might
                  reorganise food webs. Empirical evidence suggests that
                  introduced parasites alter food webs qualitatively through
                  topological changes and quantitatively through shifts in
                  trophic relationships arising from modified host phenotypic
                  traits. I argue that predicting the extent of food web
                  reorganisation is, however, difficult due to underlying
                  ecological and evolutionary processes that could provide
                  contrasting food web outcomes, including enemy release, biotic
                  resistance, and parasite spillover and spillback.
                  Nevertheless, I suggest these food web reorganisations

                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the

                  single cell type using in vitro assays in immortalized cell
                  lines or isolated cell populations, it is important to
                  remember that what is happening inside one infected cell does
                  not translate to understanding how an infected cell behaves in
                  a tissue, organ or whole organism. Infections occur in complex
                  tissue environments, which contain a host of factors that can
                  alter the course of the infection, including immune cells,
                  non-immune cells and extracellular-matrix components. These
                  factors affect how the host responds to the virus and form the
                  basis of the protective response. To understand virus
                  infection, tools are needed that can profile the tissue
                  environment. This Review highlights methods to study
                  virus-host interactions in the infection microenvironment.},

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal
                  Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial Cytochrome Oxidase

                  molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated,
                  and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units
                  are not consistent with the molecular data. We suggest that
                  Lamellodiscus morphology is probably constrained by strong
                  environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the biological sciences. While there are reliable ways to
                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for
                  species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend
                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb
                  structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under
                  different global change scenarios.},

                  scales, ecological specialisation, i.e. organisms
                  preferentially exploiting a subset of available habitats, is
                  thought to be a driver promoting niche diversity. It is not

                  specialist-generalist coexistence.MethodsWe reconstruct the
                  structure of five bacteria-phage networks from soil isolates,
                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite
                  performance.ResultsWe show that the co-occurrence of species
                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful

                  so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were
                  mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as
                  undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of
                  quantitative training: 75\% were not satisfied with their
                  understanding of mathematical models; 75\% felt that the level
                  of mathematics was "too low" in their ecology classes; 90\%
                  wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95\% more
                  statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30\% of classes
                  in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative
                  disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing

                  was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied
                  ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will
                  require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related

                  the Twentieth Century. Since the 1960s, there is a clear
                  homogenizing of human pathogens worldwide, with most diseases
                  expanding their geographical area. The occurrence network of
                  human pathogens becomes markedly more connected, and less
                  modular. Human infectious diseases are steadily expanding

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the
                  invaded patch exceeding a threshold, highlighting the likely
                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional
                  coexistence is in fact possible in an explicitly spatial
                  system and that, under some circumstances, the mutualist
                  population can exclude the enemy. More broadly, the
                  establishment of protective mutualists may be favored when
                  there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic
                  symbionts, such as vertical transmission or additional direct

               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

                  optimum (MIS 5e) available to date. This was used to calibrate

                  and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an
                  ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different
                  combinations of predictors and weighted background data. Area
                  under the curve scores computed by leave‐one‐out were used to

                  most important predictors at the continental scale, while
                  topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at
                  the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were

                  abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping
                  Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial. The
