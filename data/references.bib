  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global
                  sustainability goals.},

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  Investment in gonads and activity of mucus lysozyme were

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  of mid-nineteenth century Parisian art scene. Second, and we

                  individuals, but validation and rigour are reached through
                  collective eoorts, cross-validation, and peerage. Given enough
                  time, the conclusions reached and validated by the eoorts of
                  many will take prominence over individualities, and this (as
                  far as Bernard is concerned), is what science is about. With
                  the technology available to a modern scientist, one should
                  expect that the dissolution of me would be accelerated, and
                  that several scientists should be able to cast a critical eye
                  on data, and use this collective eoort to draw robust

                  a topical question in community ecology and results from both
                  ecological and evolutionary processes. At fine taxonomical
                  scales, ecological specialisation, i.e. organisms
                  preferentially exploiting a subset of available habitats, is
                  thought to be a driver promoting niche diversity. It is not
                  clear, however, how different mechanisms interact to shape
                  specialist-generalist coexistence.MethodsWe reconstruct the
                  structure of five bacteria-phage networks from soil isolates,
                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite
                  performance.ResultsWe show that the co-occurrence of species
                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model
                  analysis we show that infection strategies of the phages have
                  more explanatory power than bacterial defenses on key
                  structural features of these antagonistic

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful
                  measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity
                  can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic
                  levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of
                  interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic

                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be

                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental

                  predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging
                  ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why
                  species interact, as this will allow the development of
                  mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better
                  characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
                  existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that
                  the current conceptualization of species interaction networks
                  is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future
                  research must start to account for the intrinsic variability
                  of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex
                  networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
                  there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
                  properties related to the establishment of species
                  interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based
                  processes, we show that this new approach will improve our
                  predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how
                  species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
                  Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of
                  ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and
                  why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we
                  build on existing empirical literature to show that the same
                  species may happen to interact in different ways when their
                  local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or
                  when the environment affects either of these factors. We
                  discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing
                  frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species

  abstract     = {Temperature is known to influence ecosystem processes through
                  its direct effect on biological rates such as respiration and
                  nutrient cycling. These changes can then indirectly affect
                  ecologically processes by altering trophic dynamics, the
                  persistence of a species in a given environment, and,
                  consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if
                  this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
                  singularly the most important factor for the functioning of
                  ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a
                  species to the local environment also play an essential role.
                  Understanding the relative importance of these factors is
                  crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will
                  have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more complete
                  understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is
                  necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as
                  the influences of species distribution and local adaptation,
                  with ecosystem and community ecology. By using the microbial
                  community inhabiting the water-filled leaves of Sarracenia
                  purpurea, we tested the importance of temperature, trophic
                  structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem functioning. We
                  accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural
                  temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
                  common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the
                  importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of
                  each community was crossed with the temperature from each
                  site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic
                  regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the
                  mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found that
                  temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
                  origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with
                  temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of
                  temperature and biotic interactions when predicting the
                  consequences of global warming on ecosystem functioning.},

                  culture, the common chimpanzee. Although social learning of

                  argue that these findings lack ecological validity and

                  behavioral differences emerge because group members respond
                  individually to unspecified environmental differences, rather

                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring
                  patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is
                  a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting
                  subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the
                  interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an
                  open‐source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of
                  bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat
                  enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a
                  bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire

                  meta‐analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In

                  a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical

                  species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the

                  species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove
                  interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying
                  such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however,
                  remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of

                  predict species interactions using theoretical models or
                  abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach,
                  with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a
                  supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are
                  algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict
                  whether a customer will like a product given the preferences
                  of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are
                  well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they
                  focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a
                  predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey
                  around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881
                  possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results
                  for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a
                  supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can
                  predict interactions with high accuracy using only three
                  traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions
                  can be predicted without regard to the ecological community
                  given only three variables: body mass and two variables for
                  the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as
                  recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of
                  traits, using only information about other species'
                  interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as
                  random forests base their predictions on traits only but do
                  not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should
                  focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for
                  ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to
                  capture indirect relationships between species.},

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response
                  to different climate variables than do individual
                  species.LocationEurasia.Time period2000s.Major
                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to
                  β‐diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51
                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some
                  climatic variables that have no effect on species
                  distributions or dissimilarity.Main conclusionsSpecies
                  interactions capture some degree of variation that is not
                  apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this
                  system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in
                  different ways as a response to different environmental
                  factors, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss
                  the implications of this finding for the amount of information

                  range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding
                  the influence of several driving processes, we know little as
                  to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual
                  molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence
                  of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods
                  commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the
                  structure of community interaction matrices, so-called
                  bipartite networks, reflected observed co-evolutionary
                  dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not
                  have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a
                  consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one
                  previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and the other fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics.
                  Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary
                  time, but we found no evidence for a trade-off with impact on
                  bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage
                  showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence
                  that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular
                  changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor,
                  while bacteria co-evolving with the fluctuating selection
                  phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions
                  of the pilF gene associated with type IV pili. We conclude
                  that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is
                  not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary dynamics, and
                  discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was,
                  nevertheless, locally adapted.},

                  sparse matrices, are usually collected through observation
                  studies targeted at identifying species interactions. Due to
                  the extensive required sampling effort, species interaction
                  datasets usually contain many false negatives, often leading
                  to bias in derived descriptors. We show that a simple linear
                  filter can be used to detect false negatives by scoring
                  interactions based on the structure of the interaction
                  matrices. On 180 different datasets of various sizes,
                  sparsities and ecological interaction types, we found that on
                  average in about 75\% of the cases, a false negative
                  interaction got a higher score than a true negative
                  interaction. Furthermore, we show that this filter is very
                  robust, even when the interaction matrix contains a very large
                  number of false negatives. Our results demonstrate that

                  resulting in complete dissimilarity after approximately 2500
                  km. Our failure to detect a decay in network structural
                  similarity suggests the possibility that different host and
                  parasite species are filling the same functional roles in
                  interaction networks, or that variation in network similarity
                  may be better explained by other geographic variables or

                  results; however, computational science lags behind. In the

                  is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit
                  and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an
                  article about computational results is advertising, not
                  scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software
                  environment, code, and data that produced the result. This
                  implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing
                  journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely
                  requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that
                  they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience
                  is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research

                  research, promoting new and open-source implementations in
                  order to ensure that the original research can be replicated
                  from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole
                  publishing chain is radically different from other traditional
                  scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each

  abstract     = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial
                  distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the
                  way species interact with one another, but only recently
                  community ecologists realized the need to document their
                  spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an
                  integrated approach, adopting the view that community
                  structure is best represented as a network of ecological
                  interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography
                  questions. We propose that the ecological niche should
                  encompass the effect of the environment on species
                  distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on
                  the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian
                  dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a
                  quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in
                  space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction
                  distribution modeling. We apply this framework to
                  host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two
                  aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation)
                  exert a strong imprint on species co‐occurrence, but not on
                  species interactions. Even where species co‐occur, interaction
                  proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to
                  variation in realized network structure. We also find that a
                  large majority of host‐parasite pairs are never found
                  together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their
                  probability to interact. This first attempt to explain
                  variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens
                  new perspectives at the interface of species distribution
                  modeling and community ecology.},

                  diversity, structure, and function of ecological systems.
                  However, the accurate description of food webs requires
                  significant effort in time and resources, limiting their
                  widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods
                  allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy
                  variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently
                  described methods, as well as describe a composite model of
                  the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a
                  large, well‐described dataset. Both niche and neutral
                  processes are involved in determining whether or not two
                  species will form a feeding link in communities. Three
                  different models for determining niche constraints of feeding
                  interactions are compared, and all three models are extended
                  by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative
                  abundances. The three models compared here infer niche
                  processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local
                  species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a
                  composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all
                  three methods perform well at predicting individual species
                  interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up
                  to the network level, resulting in food web structure of
                  inferred networks being similar to their empirical
                  counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web
                  structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting
                  summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test
                  of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is
                  low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using
                  traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding
                  of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite
                  model of the two methods provides a framework for
                  investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait
                  distributions, and relative abundances, affect species
                  interactions, and network structure.},

                  that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes
                  shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic
                  structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is
                  contingent upon random chance, environmental filters and local
                  effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal
                  local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a
                  host–parasite system where species interactions vary
                  substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological
                  significance of individual interactions is maintained across
                  different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that
                  observed community variation at the local scale frequently
                  tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal.
                  When considered in terms of the interplay between community
                  ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate
                  that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to
                  show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even

                  increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The
                  abstraction of ecological systems - such as communities -
                  through networks of interactions between their components
                  indeed provides a way to summarize this information with
                  single objects. The methodological framework derived from
                  graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to
                  analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on
                  established ecological theories as well as tools to address
                  new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test
                  ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand,
                  adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver
                  their full potential and account for their limitations. Here,
                  we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches
                  by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so
                  far, with - what we believe to be - their appropriate uses and
                  potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all
                  methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are
                  robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a
                  brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to
                  build them in order to summarize ecological information of
                  different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the
                  types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer
                  from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis
                  testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the
                  organization of species interactions in a community yields
                  different network structures (e.g., more or less dense,
                  modular or nested), how different measures can be used to
                  describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to
                  compare communities based on these differences in structures.
                  Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to
                  describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of
                  species based on their position in the network and the
                  organization of their interactions as well as associated new
                  methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we
                  describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological
                  developments to address novel ecological questions.},

                  differ between ecosystems, there is growing evidence of
                  multiple ways in which they also exhibit common topological
                  properties. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we
                  postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions
                  underlying all ecological networks—a common substructure
                  within every network comprised of species playing similar
                  ecological roles—and a periphery of species whose
                  idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks.
                  To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to
                  investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from
                  multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant
                  differences in the way species in different ecosystems
                  interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then
                  show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of
                  interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that
                  identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the

  abstract     = {Abstract Functional diversity holds the promise of
                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic
                  diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition
                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions
                  should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an
                  effective comparison and integration across domains, and for
                  assessing whether or not to use functional diversity
                  approaches for developing ecological management strategies.
                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and
                  critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To
                  this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these
                  assumptions along a set of historical, conceptual, empirical,
                  theoretical, and normative dimensions.},

                  provide to humans are largely dependent on complex
                  interactions between prey and predators. These are embedded in
                  a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a
                  cascade of events following perturbations such as species
                  extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the
                  characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo
                  sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination
                  of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the
                  distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale
                  shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that
                  the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in
                  biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the
                  warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the
                  inferred global metaweb of marine fish-that is, all possible
                  potential feeding links between co-occurring species-is highly
                  connected geographically with a low degree of spatial
                  modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea
                  surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In
                  contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have
                  greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to
                  species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems
                  are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations
                  because of high robustness at most locations.},

  abstract     = {The structure of ecological interactions is commonly
                  understood through analyses of interaction networks. However,
                  these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases with
                  respect to both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and
                  interactions (the links between nodes), because the
                  detectability of species and their interactions is highly
                  heterogeneous. These ecological and statistical issues
                  directly affect ecologists' abilities to accurately construct
                  ecological networks. However, statistical biases introduced by
                  sampling are difficult to quantify in the absence of full
                  knowledge of the underlying ecological network's structure. To
                  explore properties of large-scale ecological networks, we
                  developed the software EcoNetGen, which constructs and samples
                  networks with predetermined topologies. These networks may
                  represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and
                  types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks
                  with different mathematical sampling designs that correspond
                  to methods used in field observations. The observed networks
                  generated by each sampling process were then analyzed with
                  respect to the number of components, size of components and
                  other network metrics. We show that the sampling effort needed
                  to estimate underlying network properties depends strongly
                  both on the sampling design and on the underlying network
                  topology. In particular, networks with random or scale-free
                  modules require more complete sampling to reveal their
                  structure, compared to networks whose modules are nested or
                  bipartite. Overall, modules with nested structure were the
                  easiest to detect, regardless of the sampling design used.
                  Sampling a network starting with any species that had a high
                  degree (e.g., abundant generalist species) was consistently
                  found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network
                  structure. Because high-degree species tend to be generalists,
                  abundant in natural communities relative to specialists, and
                  connected to each other, sampling by degree may therefore be
                  common but unintentional in empirical sampling of networks.
                  Conversely, sampling according to module (representing
                  different interaction types or taxa) results in a rather
                  complete view of certain modules, but fails to provide a
                  complete picture of the underlying network. To reduce biases
                  introduced by sampling methods, we recommend that these
                  findings be incorporated into field design considerations for
                  projects aiming to characterize large species interaction
                  networks.},

                  task for public health professionals and epidemiologists.
                  Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly
                  generating datasets that are worth more than their component
                  parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free
                  approach which leverages information on the global community
                  of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of
                  pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise
                  dissimilarities between countries' pathogen communities and
                  pathogens' geographical distributions and uses these to
                  predict country-pathogen associations. We compare the success
                  rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence
                  and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number
                  of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g.
                  virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only
                  these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic
                  network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that
                  while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well
                  captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events
                  remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an
                  influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the
                  model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely
                  to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model
                  is able to use the information on the existing
                  country-pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly
                  well, suggesting the importance in considering information on
                  co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate
                  outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.},
