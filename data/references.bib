                  cause overestimation of the effects under study, thereby
                  violating the reproducibility of the research and potentially
                  leading to incorrect conclusions in subsequent research
                  syntheses. We explored the level of knowledge about biases and
                  attitudes to this problem by analysing 308 responses of
                  ecology scientists to a specifically developed survey. We show
                  that knowledge about biases and attitude towards biases depend
                  on the scientist's career stage, gender and affiliation
                  country. Early career scientists are more concerned about
                  biases, know more about measures to avoid biases, and twice
                  more frequently have learned about biases from their
                  university courses when compared with senior scientists. The
                  respondents believe that their own studies are less prone to
                  biases than are studies by other scientists, which hampers the

                  education about biases is necessary, but not yet sufficient,
                  to avoid biases because the unconscious origin of biases
                  necessitates external intervention to combat them. Obligatory
                  reporting of measures taken against biases in all relevant
                  manuscripts will likely enhance the reproducibility of

                  evaluated the potential for geographic, taxonomic, and
                  citation biases in publications between temperate and tropical
                  systems for nine broad topics in ecology and evolutionary
                  biology. Across 1,800 papers sampled from 60,000
                  peer-reviewed, empirical studies, we found consistent patterns
                  of bias in the form of increased numbers of studies in
                  temperate systems. Tropical studies were nearly absent from
                  some topics. Furthermore, there were strong taxonomic biases
                  across topics and geographic regions, as well as evidence for
                  citation biases in many topics. Our results indicate a strong
                  geographic imbalance in publishing patterns and among
                  different taxonomic groups across a wide range of topics. The
                  task ahead is to address what these biases mean and how they

                  research and education is a highly topical issue. The recent
                  release of ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre‐trained Transformer)
                  by OpenAI on November 30, 2022 has opened up new possibilities
                  for the use of chatbot services in ecological research and
                  education. In this perspective article, we address associated
                  contemporary topics including the use of chatbot services in
                  ecology education and academic writing, the application of AI
                  in ecology, the potential environmental impact, and ethical
                  considerations of using such services. Several logistical,
                  ethical and environmental factors were identified that should
                  be considered in the context of ecological research. We argue
                  that ChatGPT can help reduce the workload of researchers,
                  generate new insights and ideas, and serve as a personal
                  instructor and assistant for students. While we show how AI
                  chatbots have the potential to be useful assets for
                  ecologists, several challenges arose. AI in ecological
                  research includes the limited ability of AI algorithms to
                  capture complexity and nuance, the dependence of AI models on
                  data quality, and ethical concerns about the use of AI in
                  research. The construction and operation of such services also
                  have potential environmental impacts but may also provide
                  environmental benefits in comparison with other conventional
                  approaches, all of which should be evaluated. Despite these
                  limitations and challenges, we consider that the use of AI can
                  be a valuable tool in ecological research and could enhance
                  the speed and efficiency of research by automating certain
                  tasks (e.g. data collection and management) and analyzing
                  large amounts of data. However, we emphasize the importance of
                  taking a responsible, sustainable and transparent approach to
                  using chatbot services and AI in ecological research and
                  education, while remaining mindful of the potential impact on

                  for writing succinct and rigorous descriptions of
                  probabilistic models and inference tasks. Several
                  probabilistic programming languages, including Anglican,
                  Church or Hakaru, derive their expressiveness from a powerful
                  combination of continuous distributions, conditioning, and
                  higher-order functions. Although very important for practical
                  applications, these features raise fundamental challenges for
                  program semantics and verification. Several recent works offer
                  promising answers to these challenges, but their primary focus
                  is on foundational semantics issues. In this paper, we take a
                  step further by developing a suite of logics, collectively
                  named PPV for proving properties of programs written in an
                  expressive probabilistic higher-order language with continuous
                  sampling operations and primitives for conditioning
                  distributions. Our logics mimic the comfortable reasoning
                  style of informal proofs using carefully selected
                  axiomatizations of key results from probability theory. The
                  versatility of our logics is illustrated through the formal
                  verification of several intricate examples from statistics,
                  probabilistic inference, and machine learning. We further show
                  expressiveness by giving sound embeddings of existing logics.
                  In particular, we do this in a parametric way by showing how
                  the semantics idea of (unary and relational) ⊤⊤-lifting can be
                  internalized in our logics. The soundness of PPV follows by
                  interpreting programs and assertions in quasi-Borel spaces
                  (QBS), a recently proposed variant of Borel spaces with a good
                  structure for interpreting higher order probabilistic
                  programs.},

                  Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal
                  linguistic competence--knowledge of linguistic rules and
                  patterns--and functional linguistic competence--understanding
                  and using language in the world. We ground this distinction in
                  human neuroscience, showing that formal and functional
                  competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs
                  are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance
                  on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often
                  requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external

              generated images have been shared on the Internet. Meanwhile,
              today's success of deep learning in the computer vision field owes
              a lot to images collected from the Internet. These trends lead us
              to a research question: "\textbf{will such generated images impact

              answers this question by simulating contamination. Namely, we

              state-of-the-art generative model and evaluate models trained with

                  Arguments also varied in lexical content, involving blocks and
                  pseudo-words in Experiment I and faces and houses in

                  medial (BA 8) prefrontal cortex, perform deductive operations.
                  Finally, restricting the complex-simple subtraction to each

                  interact with more species or can occur in wider range of
                  habitats. However, there is no consensus on whether generalism
                  drives abundance (a selection process) or abundance drives
                  generalism (a drift process). As it is difficult to conduct
                  direct experiments to solve this chicken-and-egg dilemma,
                  previous studies have used a causal discovery method based on
                  formal logic and have found that abundance drives generalism.
                  Here, we refine this method by correcting its bias regarding
                  skewed distributions, and employ two other independent causal
                  discovery methods based on nonparametric regression and on
                  information theory, respectively. Contrary to previous work,
                  all three independent methods strongly indicate that
                  generalism drives abundance when applied to datasets on
                  plant-hummingbird communities and reef fishes. Furthermore, we
                  find that selection processes are more important than drift
                  processes in structuring multispecies systems when the
                  environment is variable. Our results showcase the power of the
                  computational causal discovery approach to aid ecological
                  research.},

                  statistics have no spatial component and do not address errors
                  in the predictions. It is proposed that maps of uncertainty

                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic
                  diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition
                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions
                  should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an
                  effective comparison and integration across domains, and for
                  assessing whether or not to use functional diversity
                  approaches for developing ecological management strategies.
                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and
                  critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To
                  this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these

                  pose a particular challenge because of their genetic
                  diversity, asexual reproduction, and often promiscuous
                  horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, microbes also present
                  an opportunity to study and understand speciation because of
                  their rapid evolution, both in nature and in the lab, and
                  small, easily sequenced genomes. Here, we review how microbial
                  population genomics has enabled us to catch speciation "in the
                  act" and how the results have challenged and enriched our
                  concepts of species, with implications for all domains of
                  life. We describe how recombination (including HGT and
                  introgression) has shaped the genomes of nascent microbial,
                  animal, and plant species and argue for a prominent role of
                  natural selection in initiating and maintaining speciation. We
                  ask how universal is the process of speciation across the tree
                  of life, and what lessons can be drawn from microbes?
                  Comparative genomics showing the extent of HGT in natural
                  populations certainly jeopardizes the relevance of vertical
                  descent (i.e., the species tree) in speciation. Nevertheless,
                  we conclude that species do indeed exist as clusters of
                  genetic and ecological similarity and that speciation is
                  driven primarily by natural selection, regardless of the
                  balance between horizontal and vertical descent.},

                  multiple meanings associated with them. While this could lead
                  to confusion, discord, or even tests that violate core
                  assumptions of a given theory or model, this ambiguity could
                  also be a feature that allows for new knowledge creation
                  through the interconnected nature of concepts. We approached
                  this debate from a quantitative perspective, and investigated
                  the cost of ambiguity related to definitions of ecological
                  units in ecology related to the general term “community.” We
                  did a meta-analysis of tests associated with two bodies of
                  literature, Hubbell’s unified neutral theory of biodiversity
                  and biogeography and Diamond’s assembly rules, that rely on a
                  specific ecological unit that assumes that species are
                  existing within a local area and that they have overlapping
                  resource needs. We predicted that if ambiguous terminology is
                  widespread, then researchers will have tested them with many
                  different ecological units, that in addition some of these
                  ecological units will violate the core assumptions of the
                  theory, and finally that the overall level of support for a
                  theory will be stronger if appropriate ecological units were
                  used. We found that indeed multiple different ecological units
                  were used in the literature to test both theories, with 65
                  percent appropriate ecological units for neutral theory tests,
                  and only 6 percent for assembly rule tests. Finally, there was
                  some evidence that the support for a theory depended on
                  whether appropriate ecological units were used for neutral
                  tests, but there was not enough data for the assembly rule
                  tests. These results thus show that ambiguous terminology in
                  ecology is having measurable effects on research and is not of
                  solely philosophical concern. We advocate that authors be
                  explicit in their writing and outline core assumptions of
                  theories, that researchers apply these consistently in their
                  tests, and that readers be attentive to what is written and
                  cognizant of their potential biases.]}

                  frameworks in operationalising and mainstreaming the idea of
                  ecosystem services. It builds on some initial discussions from
                  IPBES, which suggested that conceptual frameworks could be
                  used to: 'simplify thinking', 'structure work', 'clarify
                  issues', and 'provide a common reference point'. The analysis
                  uses the cascade model as a focus and looks at the way it has
                  been used in recent published material and across a set of
                  case studies from the EU-funded OpenNESS Project as a device
                  for conceptual framing. It found that there are examples in
                  the literature that show the cascade model indeed being used
                  as an 'organising framework', a tool for 're-framing'
                  perspectives, an 'analytical template', and as an 'application
                  framework'. Although the published materials on the cascade
                  are rich, these accounts lack insights into the process by
                  which the different versions of the model were created, and so
                  we turned to the set of OpenNESS case studies to examine how
                  they read the cascade. We found that the cascade was able to
                  provide a common reference for a diverse set of studies, and
                  that it was sufficiently flexible for it to be developed and
                  elaborated in ways that were meaningful for the different
                  place-based studies. The case studies showed that generalised
                  models like the cascade can have an important
                  'awareness-raising' role. However, we found that using models
                  of this kind it was more difficult for case studies to link
                  their work to broader societal issues such as human
                  well-being, sustainable ecosystem management, governance, and
                  competitiveness, than to their own concerns. We therefore
                  conclude that to be used effectively, conceptual models like
                  the cascade may need to be supported by other materials that
                  help users read it in different, outward looking ways. We also
                  need to find mechanisms for capturing this experience so that
                  it can be shared with others.},

  abstract     = {Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or
                  Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we
                  communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation,
                  in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI
                  models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new
                  generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI
                  regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their
                  capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal
                  part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct
                  regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and
                  (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to
                  capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by
                  differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers,
                  professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients
                  of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these
                  different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies
                  to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the
                  benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other
                  direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained
                  models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations
                  concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk
                  obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the
                  AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on
                  concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model
                  itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding
                  transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination
                  provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers.
                  Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA content moderation rules
                  should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and
                  action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers. In all areas,
                  regulators and lawmakers need to act fast to keep track with
                  the dynamics of ChatGPT et al.},

                  BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional
                  representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
                  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the

  abstract     = {1.The exponential growth of scientific literature—which we
                  call the “big literature” phenomenon—has created great
                  challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The
                  traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often
                  unable to take advantage of big literature due to human
                  limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new
                  literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. 2.In
                  this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis
                  approach, Automated Content Analysis (ACA), which has not yet
                  been widely adopted in the fields of ecological and
                  evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine-learning tools
                  for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big
                  literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical
                  research. 3.Our goal is to introduce ecologists and
                  evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to
                  synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we
                  provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the
                  fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies
                  to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in
                  synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally,
                  we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of
                  ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to
                  advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary
                  research. 4.Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA
                  is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially
                  shorter timespans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The
                  overall efficiency and versatility of this method allows for a
                  broad range of applications for literature review and
                  synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic
                  reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By
                  allowing for more extensive and comprehensive review of big
                  literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important
                  methodological gap and to therefore contribute to the
                  advancement of ecological and evolutionary research. This

                  demarcating the limits of ecological networks. We tested
                  whether large-scale ecological boundaries (ecoregions and

                  among plant-frugivore networks, while accounting for
                  background spatial and elevational gradients and differences
                  in network sampling. We assessed network dissimilarity
                  patterns over a broad spatial scale, using 196 quantitative
                  avian frugivory networks (encompassing 1496 plant and 1004
                  bird species) distributed across 67 ecoregions, 11 biomes, and

                  overabundant in the ensemble of subgraphs, have more edges,
                  for a given number of nodes, than antimotifs and generally
                  display a bipartite structure or tend toward a complete graph.
                  In contrast, antimotifs, which are underabundant connected
                  pieces, are mostly trees or contain at most a single, small
                  loop.},

                  needed to identify host species with a high risk of zoonotic
                  disease spillover. While several predictors of pathogen
                  richness in wildlife hosts have been proposed, their relative
                  importance has not been formally examined. This hampers our
                  ability to identify potential disease reservoirs, particularly
                  in remote areas with limited surveillance efforts. Here we
                  analyzed 14 proposed predictors of pathogen richness using
                  ensemble modeling and a dataset of 1040 host species to
                  identify the most important predictors of pathogen richness in
                  wild mammal species. After controlling for research effort,
                  larger species geographic range area was identified to be
                  associated with higher pathogen richness. We found evidence of
                  duality in the relationship between the fast–slow continuum of
                  life-history traits and pathogen richness, where pathogen
                  richness increases near the extremities. Taxonomic orders
                  Carnivora, Proboscidea, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla were
                  predicted to host high pathogen richness. The top three
                  species with the highest pathogen richness predicted by our
                  ensemble model were Canis lupus, Sus scrofa, and Alces alces.

                  surveillance and disease reservoir management to prevent the

                  study aimed to identify the relative importance of five
                  factors (i.e., conservation targets, threat levels, costs,
                  Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and preexisting
                  investment) that potentially influence conservation funding
                  allocation at the subnational level in major deforestation
                  regions of South America between 1987 and 2013. Overall, we
                  found that funding was mainly allocated to remote areas with
                  high species richness and carbon storage, while areas with
                  high threat levels were often overlooked, especially until
                  2008. After 2008, international donors committed more funding
                  to areas with high carbon storage, but not areas with high
                  species richness, suggesting the prominence of climate-related
                  concerns over biodiversity conservation. Although often
                  advocated, we did not find evidence supporting Indigenous
                  Peoples and local communities being important in explaining
                  funding allocation. However, we identified a strong preference
                  for the Amazon as a charismatic ecoregion. Our findings
                  underscore the diverse and changing factors that drive

                  and significant health burden. The spatial limits of its
                  distribution and seasonal activity are sensitive to climate
                  factors, as well as the local capacity to control the disease.
                  Malaria is also one of the few health outcomes that has been
                  modeled by more than one research group and can therefore
                  facilitate the first model intercomparison for health impacts
                  under a future with climate change. We used bias-corrected
                  temperature and rainfall simulations from the Coupled Model
                  Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models to compare the
                  metrics of five statistical and dynamical malaria impact
                  models for three future time periods (2030s, 2050s, and
                  2080s). We evaluated three malaria outcome metrics at global
                  and regional levels: climate suitability, additional
                  population at risk and additional person-months at risk across
                  the model outputs. The malaria projections were based on five
                  different global climate models, each run under four emission
                  scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) and a
                  single population projection. We also investigated the
                  modeling uncertainty associated with future projections of
                  populations at risk for malaria owing to climate change. Our
                  findings show an overall global net increase in climate
                  suitability and a net increase in the population at risk, but
                  with large uncertainties. The model outputs indicate a net
                  increase in the annual person-months at risk when comparing
                  from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 from the 2050s to the 2080s. The malaria
                  outcome metrics were highly sensitive to the choice of malaria

                  approaches to combat bacterial infections and better
                  understanding microbial ecology. Experimental studies on
                  phage-bacteria interactions have been mostly focusing on a few
                  model organisms to understand the molecular mechanisms which
                  makes a particular bacterial strain susceptible to a given
                  phage. However, both bacteria and phages are extremely diverse
                  in natural contexts. How well the concepts learned from
                  well-established experimental models generalize to a broad
                  diversity of what is encountered in the wild is currently
                  unknown. Recent advances in genomics allow to identify traits
                  involved in phage-host specificity, implying that these traits
                  could be utilized for the prediction of such interactions.
                  Here, we show that we could predict outcomes of most
                  phage-bacteria interactions at the strain level in Escherichia
                  natural isolates based solely on genomic data. First, we
                  established a dataset of experimental outcomes of
                  phage-bacteria interactions of 403 natural, phylogenetically
                  diverse, Escherichia strains to 96 bacteriophages matched with
                  fully sequenced and genomically characterized strains and
                  phages. To predict these interactions, we set out to define
                  genomic traits with predictive power. We show that most
                  interactions in our dataset can be explained by adsorption
                  factors as opposed to antiphage systems which play a marginal
                  role. We then trained predictive algorithms to pinpoint which
                  interactions could be accurately predicted and where future
                  research should focus on. Finally, we show the application of
                  such predictions by establishing a pipeline to recommend
                  tailored phage cocktails to target pathogenic strains from
                  their genomes only and show higher efficiency of tailored
                  cocktails on a collection of 100 pathogenic E. coli isolates.

                  milestone in computational programming, mathematical analysis,
                  and statistical modeling. Having reached its stable release in
                  version 1.9.0 on May 7, 2023, Julia has developed into a
                  powerful and versatile instrument. Despite its potential and
                  widespread adoption across various scientific and technical
                  domains, it can be utilized within biological sciences. The
                  Aim of Review This comprehensive review aims to address this
                  particular knowledge gap and offer a thorough examination of
                  Julia's fundamental characteristics and its applications in
                  biology. Key scientific concepts of the review The review
                  focuses on a research gap in the biological science. The
                  review aims to equip researchers with knowledge and tools to
                  utilize Julia's capabilities in biological science effectively
                  and to demonstrate the gap. It paves the way for innovative
                  solutions and discoveries in this rapidly evolving field. It
                  encompasses an analysis of Julia's characteristics, packages,
                  and performance compared to the programming languages in this
                  field. The initial part of this review discusses the key
                  features of Julia, such as its dynamic and interactive nature,
                  fast processing speed, ease of expression manipulation,
                  user-friendly syntax, code readability, strong support for
                  multiple dispatch, and advanced type system. It also explores
                  Julia's capabilities in data analysis, visualization, machine
                  learning, and algorithms, making it suitable for scientific
                  applications. The next section emphasizes the importance of
                  using Julia in biological research, highlighting its seamless
                  integration with biological studies for data analysis,
                  computational biology, and bioinformatics. It also compares

                  recent years; approximately 60\% of these emerging diseases
                  are of zoonotic origin, and of those, around 70\% were
                  identified to start with wild animals. To better understand
                  the impacts of zoonotic diseases on wildlife, there is a need
                  to identify the distribution and impact of zoonotic pathogens
                  in wildlife, particular those species with threatened
                  populations. To investigate this question, we constructed a
                  zoonotic disease database identifying wildlife hosts for each
                  bacterial zoonotic disease and recorded clinical signs of
                  disease for each host-pathogen relationship if found. Species
                  of least concern were found to have a significantly higher
                  prevalence and richness of zoonotic bacterial diseases (n=
                  0.0608, x2 = 5.898, p=0.01516). The taxonomic level Order was
                  found to be the best predictor for pathogen richness, and the
                  Artiodactyla and Carnivora contain a significantly higher
                  pathogen richness than other vertebrate Orders. Species with
                  the greatest pathogen richness include the wild boar (Sus
                  scrofa, n=66), Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor, n=16) and the
                  red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n=41). Our results indicate bacterial
                  zoonoses are not likely to be a driving factor of species
                  population declines, and future zoonotic disease surveillance
                  efforts should target species in the Artiodactyla and
                  Carnivora families. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) in particular
                  may be a good candidate for zoonotic disease monitoring due to
                  its high pathogen richness, wide range, and large population.
                  Understanding the impacts and distribution of bacterial
                  zoonoses in wildlife populations can help in planning for
                  future wildlife management efforts, particularly in species of

                  the maintenance of individual differences in behavior and
                  physiology is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The
                  pace‐of‐life syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain
                  the maintenance of such within‐population variation. This
                  hypothesis predicts that behavioral traits are part of a suite
                  of correlated traits that collectively determine an
                  individual's propensity to prioritize reproduction or
                  survival. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that these
                  traits are underpinned by genetic trade‐offs among
                  life‐history traits: genetic variants that increase fertility,
                  reproduction and growth might also reduce lifespan. We
                  performed a systematic literature review and meta‐analysis to
                  summarize the evidence for the existence of genetic trade‐offs
                  between five key life‐history traits: survival, growth rate,
                  body size, maturation rate, and fertility. Counter to our
                  predictions, we found an overall positive genetic correlation
                  between survival and other life‐history traits and no evidence
                  for any genetic correlations between the non‐survival
                  life‐history traits. This finding was generally consistent
                  across pairs of life‐history traits, sexes, life stages, lab
                  vs. field studies, and narrow‐ vs. broad‐sense correlation
                  estimates. Our study highlights that genetic trade‐offs may
                  not be as common, or at least not as easily quantifiable, in
                  animals as often assumed.},

                  approximately 20\% of co-occurrences correspond to actual
                  interactions. Moreover, the degree distribution shifts from
                  exponential in co-occurrence networks to power laws in
                  networks of biotic interactions. This shift results from a
                  strong interplay between species’ biotic (their interacting
                  partners) and abiotic (their environmental requirements)
                  niches, and is accurately predicted by considering

                  fragmentation, which can have several effects on wildlife,
                  including altered parasite dynamics. Bats are a useful host
                  group to consider the effects of fragmentation, because they
                  are abundant in the tropics, serve important ecological roles,
                  and harbor many parasites. Nevertheless, research on the
                  effects of fragmentation on bat ectoparasites is still
                  limited. To help guide ongoing and future research efforts,
                  this study had two objectives: (1) conduct a gap analysis to
                  characterize the state of currently available research on
                  fragmentation effects on bat ectoparasites and (2) conduct a
                  preliminary meta-analysis to identify current trends. We
                  systematically highlighted several research gaps: Studies
                  comparing the effects of fragmented versus continuous forests
                  on ectoparasites are limited and have primarily been conducted
                  in the Neotropics, with a focus on bats in the superfamily
                  Noctilionidea (especially frugivorous phyllostomids). Our
                  preliminary meta-analysis suggested that ectoparasite
                  prevalence (but not the mean or variance in intensity) was
                  higher in fragments than in continuous forests. Moreover,
                  prevalence increased with increasing roost duration, and mean
                  intensity was higher for bats with higher wing aspect ratios.
                  Intensity variance was affected by an interaction between
                  forest type and wing aspect ratio, such that variance
                  increased for bats with high-wing aspect ratios in continuous
                  forests but decreased in fragments. These results suggest that
                  fragmentation can shape aspects of bat ectoparasitism and
                  could have implications for the ecology, health, and
                  conservation of bats in fragmented landscapes. However,
                  existing research gaps could bias our current understanding of
                  habitat change and bat health, and future research should thus
                  investigate these effects in the Paleotropics and with other
                  bat families.},

                  group to consider these effects, because they harbour many
                  relevant zoonotic viruses and have species‐ and
                  context‐dependent responses to degradation that could affect
                  zoonotic virus dynamics. Yet our understanding of the
                  associations between habitat degradation and bat virus
                  prevalence and seroprevalence are limited to a small number of
                  studies, which often differ in the bats or viruses sampled,
                  the study region, and methodology. To develop a broad
                  understanding of the associations between bat viruses and
                  habitat degradation, we conducted an initial phylogenetic
                  meta‐analysis that combines published prevalence and
                  seroprevalence (‘(sero)prevalence') with remote‐sensing
                  habitat degradation data. Our dataset includes 588 unique
                  records of (sero)prevalence across 16 studies, 64 bat species,
                  and five virus families. We quantified the overall strength
                  and direction of the relationship between habitat degradation
                  and bat virus outcomes and tested how this relationship is
                  moderated by the time between habitat degradation and bat
                  sampling and by ecological traits of bat hosts while
                  controlling for phylogenetic non‐independence among bat
                  species. We found no effect of degradation on prevalence
                  overall, although a weak effect may exist when forest loss
                  occurs the year prior to bat sampling. In contrast, we
                  detected a negative but weak association between degradation
                  and seroprevalence overall that was strengthened when forest
                  loss occurred the year prior to bat sampling. No bat traits
                  that we investigated interacted with habitat degradation to
                  impact virus outcomes, suggesting observed trends are
                  independent of these traits. Biases in our initial dataset
                  highlight opportunities for future work; prevalence was highly
                  zero‐inflated, and seroprevalence was dominated by Desmodus
                  rotundus and rabies virus. These findings and subsequent
                  analyses will improve our understanding of how global change

                  overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a
                  census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass
                  distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that
                  the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the
                  planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily
                  terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and
                  bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly

                  health, with dengue representing a growing concern due to its
                  high existing burden and sensitivity to climatic conditions.
                  Yet, the quantitative impacts of temperature warming on
                  dengue, both in the past and in the future, remain poorly
                  understood. In this study, we quantify how dengue responds to
                  climatic fluctuations, and use this inferred temperature
                  response to estimate the impacts of historical warming and
                  forecast trends under future climate change scenarios. To
                  estimate the causal impact of temperature on the spread of
                  dengue in the Americas and Asia, we assembled a dataset
                  encompassing nearly 1.5 million dengue incidence records from
                  21 countries. Our analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship
                  between temperature and dengue incidence with the largest
                  marginal effects at lower temperatures (around 15°C), peak
                  incidence at 27.8°C (95\% CI: 27.3 - 28.2°C), and subsequent
                  declines at higher temperatures. Our findings indicate that
                  historical climate change has already increased dengue
                  incidence 18\% (12 - 25\%) in the study region, and
                  projections suggest a potential increase of 40\% (17 - 76) to
                  57\% (33 - 107\%) by mid-century depending on the climate
                  scenario, with some areas seeing up to 200\% increases.
                  Notably, our models suggest that lower emissions scenarios
                  would substantially reduce the warming-driven increase in
                  dengue burden. Together, these insights contribute to the
                  broader understanding of how long-term climate patterns
                  influence dengue, providing a valuable foundation for public
                  health planning and the development of strategies to mitigate
                  future risks due to climate change.},

                  crocodylians, number fewer than 30 species, more than 700
                  pseudosuchian species are known from their 250-million-year
                  fossil record, displaying far greater ecomorphological
                  diversity than their extant counterparts. With a new
                  time-calibrated tree of >500 species, we use a phylogenetic
                  framework to reveal that pseudosuchian evolutionary history
                  and diversification dynamics were directly shaped by the
                  interplay of abiotic and biotic processes over hundreds of
                  millions of years, supported by information theory analyses.
                  Speciation, but not extinction, is correlated with higher
                  temperatures in terrestrial and marine lineages, with high sea
                  level associated with heightened extinction in non-marine
                  taxa. Low lineage diversity and increased speciation in
                  non-marine species is consistent with opportunities for
                  niche-filling, whereas increased competition may have led to
                  elevated extinction rates. In marine lineages, competition via
                  increased lineage diversity appears to have driven both
                  speciation and extinction. Decoupling speciation and
                  extinction, in combination with ecological partitioning,
                  reveals a more complex picture of pseudosuchian evolution than
                  previously understood. As the number of species threatened
                  with extinction by anthropogenic climate change continues to
                  rise, the fossil record provides a unique window into the
                  drivers that led to clade success and those that may
                  ultimately lead to extinction.},

                  Modulation of hormone titres, as proposed by the challenge
                  hypothesis, provides a mechanism by which individuals can
                  match their behaviour to their current social environment and
                  thereby avoid costs associated with prolonged high hormone
                  titres. Thus far, most work on social responsiveness of
                  hormone titres has focused on androgens in vertebrates.
                  However, there is mounting evidence that insect hormones,
                  especially juvenile hormone, may respond to social stimuli in
                  ways that parallel androgens in vertebrates. This review will
                  integrate work on social modulation of hormone titres in
                  vertebrates and insects. First we review how the
                  hormone-mediated trade-off between fecundity and life span may
                  be a key selective force favouring socially responsive hormone
                  titres in both systems. Then we review theoretical and
                  empirical work in vertebrates and insects that address how
                  factors such as social instability, dominance rank and mating
                  system influence hormone titre responsiveness. These studies
                  illustrate that (1) juvenile hormone (JH) is responsive to
                  social stimuli in a range of insect taxa and (2) JH responses
                  match key predictions of the challenge hypothesis. We conclude
                  that there are strong similarities in endocrine responsiveness
                  across vertebrate and insect taxa. The challenge hypothesis
                  provides a useful conceptual framework for hypothesis-driven
                  research in insect endocrinology. In addition, exploring areas
                  of convergence and divergence across vertebrates and insects
                  may help clarify how selection has shaped patterns of
                  endocrine responsiveness.},

                  single-stranded RNA and are among the largest viral RNAs known
                  to date (∼30 kb). As a result, CoVs deploy sophisticated
                  mechanisms to replicate these extraordinarily large genomes as
                  well as to transcribe subgenomic messenger RNAs. Since 2003,
                  with the emergence of three highly pathogenic CoVs (SARS-CoV,
                  MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), significant progress has been made
                  in the molecular characterization of the viral proteins and
                  key mechanisms involved in CoV RNA genome replication. For
                  example, to allow for the maintenance and integrity of their
                  large RNA genomes, CoVs have acquired RNA proofreading 3'-5'
                  exoribonuclease activity (in nonstructural protein nsp14). In
                  order to replicate the large genome, the viral-RNA-dependent
                  RNA polymerase (RdRp; in nsp12) is supplemented by a
                  processivity factor (made of the viral complex nsp7/nsp8),
                  making it the fastest known RdRp. Lastly, a viral structural
                  protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is primarily
                  involved in genome encapsidation, is required for efficient
                  viral replication and transcription. Therefore, CoVs are a
                  paradox among positive-strand RNA viruses in the sense that
                  they use both a processivity factor and have proofreading
                  activity reminiscent of DNA organisms in addition to
                  structural proteins that mediate efficient RNA synthesis,
                  commonly used by negative-strand RNA viruses. In this review,

                  discoveries and detail the current knowledge on the core

                  biologists for nearly two centuries and are increasingly
                  important in our era of global climate change. These
                  relationships are hypothesized to originate from the
                  temperature‐dependent kinetics of rate‐limiting biochemical
                  reactions of metabolism. Several prominent theories have
                  formalized this hypothesis using the Arrhenius model, which
                  characterizes a monotonic temperature dependence using an
                  activation energy E. However, the ubiquitous unimodal nature
                  of biological temperature responses presents important
                  theoretical, methodological, and conceptual challenges that
                  restrict the promise for insight, prediction, and progress.
                  Here we review the development of key hypotheses and methods
                  for the temperature‐scaling of biological rates. Using
                  simulations, we examine the constraints of monotonic models,
                  illustrating their sensitivity to data nuances such as
                  temperature range and noise, and their tendency to yield
                  variable and underestimated E, with critical consequences for
                  climate change predictions. We also evaluate the behaviour of
                  two prominent unimodal models when applied to incomplete and
                  noisy datasets. We conclude with recommendations for resolving
                  these challenges in future research, and advocate for a shift
                  to unimodal models that better characterize the full range of

                  that make up these ecological networks are lacking for most
                  taxa in most ecosystems. Trait‐based models can fill these

                  ecological communities both in terms of pairwise predator–prey
                  interactions and higher level food web attributes (i.e.

                  models of pairwise trophic interactions on four independent
                  vertebrate food webs (Canadian tundra, Serengeti, alpine
                  south‐eastern Pyrenees and Europe) and evaluate how well these
                  models predict pairwise interactions and network properties of

                  predict most interactions and their absence correctly.
                  Performance was best for training and testing on the same food
                  web (AUC > 0.90) and declined with environmental and
                  phylogenetic distances with the strongest loss of performance
                  for the tundra‐Serengeti ecosystems (AUC > 0.75). Network
                  metrics were less well‐predicted than single interactions by
                  our models with predicted food webs being more connected, less
                  modular, and with higher mean trophic levels than
                  observed.Main ConclusionsTheory predicts that the variability
                  observed in food webs can be explained by differences in trait
                  distributions and trait‐matching relationships. Our finding
                  that trait‐based models can predict many trophic interactions,
                  even in contrasting environments, adds to the growing body of
                  evidence that there are general constraints on interactions
                  and that trait‐based methods can serve as a useful first
                  approximation of food webs in unknown areas. However, food
                  webs are more than the sum of their parts, and predicting
                  network attributes will likely require models that
                  simultaneously predict individual interactions and community
                  constraints.},

                  applying theory to enhance implementation efforts. The
                  Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by
                  Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31
                  planned action theories. The framework has two components:
                  Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which
                  comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two
                  questions: 'Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so,
                  how?' METHODS: This study is a citation analysis and
                  systematic review. The index citation for the original paper
                  was identified on three databases-Web of Science, Scopus and
                  Google Scholar-with the facility for citation searching.
                  Limitations of English language and year of publication
                  2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum
                  of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to
                  implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and
                  mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where
                  it was integral to the implementation project. RESULTS: The
                  citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles
                  and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies
                  described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to
                  integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to
                  the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation
                  activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven
                  referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted
                  in different health care and academic settings with projects
                  targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied
                  health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The KTA Framework is being
                  used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is
                  frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution
                  via a reference, through informing planning, to making an
                  intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to
                  knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways
                  and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages
                  the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet
                  their application is less evident in practice. This may be an
                  artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary
                  research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA
                  Framework and similar tools.},

                  comparative impact of synthesis, the role of synthesis in
                  driving key research themes, and whether synthesis is focused
                  on different topics than is the broader ecological literature.
                  We found much higher citation rates for synthesis papers
                  overall (fivefold more) and within eleven key topic themes
                  (e.g., species richness, biodiversity, climate change, global
                  change). Synthesis papers often played key roles in driving,
                  redirecting, or resolving core questions and exhibited much
                  greater cross-theme connectivity. Together, these results
                  indicate that synthesis in science has played a crucial role
                  in accelerating and advancing ecological knowledge.},

                  peer evaluation is the main method used to distribute scarce
                  resources. A large literature documents gender inequality in
                  evaluation, and the explanation for this inequality is
                  homophily: male evaluators give more favorable ratings to male
                  candidates. We investigate this by focusing on cum laude
                  distinctions for PhD students in the Netherlands, a
                  distinction that is only awarded to 5 percent of all
                  dissertations and has as its sole goal to distinguish the top
                  from the rest. Using data from over 5000 PhD recipients of a
                  large Dutch university for the period 2011–2021, we find that
                  female PhD students were almost two times less likely to get a
                  cum laude distinction than their male counterparts, even when
                  they had the same doctoral advisor. This gender gap is largest
                  when dissertations are evaluated by all-male committees and
                  decreases as evaluation committees include more female
                  members.},

                  was tasked with drafting an instrument in an ambitious
                  timeline of two years—considerably shorter than most
                  international legal negotiations—with an assumption that the

                  pathogen in Europe where it represents a new public health
                  threat. While climate change has been cited as a potential
                  driver of its spatial expansion on the continent, a formal
                  evaluation of this causal relationship is lacking. Here, we
                  investigate the extent to which WNV spatial expansion in
                  Europe can be attributed to climate change while accounting
                  for other direct human influences such as land-use and human
                  population changes. To this end, we trained ecological niche
                  models to predict the risk of local WNV circulation leading to
                  human cases to then unravel the isolated effect of climate
                  change by comparing factual simulations to a counterfactual
                  based on the same environmental changes but a counterfactual
                  climate where long-term trends have been removed. Our findings
                  demonstrate a notable increase in the area ecologically
                  suitable for WNV circulation during the period 1901–2019,
                  whereas this area remains largely unchanged in a
                  no-climate-change counterfactual. We show that the drastic
                  increase in the human population at risk of exposure is partly
                  due to historical changes in population density, but that
                  climate change has also been a critical driver behind the
                  heightened risk of WNV circulation in Europe.},

                  identification and isolation of a FiV, Dehong virus (DEHV),
                  from Rousettus leschenaultii bats. DEHV has a typical
                  filovirus-like morphology with a wide spectrum of cell
                  tropism. Its entry into cells depends on the engagement of
                  Niemann-Pick C1, and its replication is inhibited by
                  remdesivir. DEHV has the largest genome size of filoviruses,
                  with phylogenetic analysis placing it between the genera
                  Dianlovirus and Orthomarburgvirus , suggesting its

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases
                  (EIDs), such as Ebola virus disease and highly pathogenic
                  influenza, are serious threats to human health and wellbeing
                  worldwide. The financial sector has an important, yet often
                  ignored, influence as owners and investors in industries that
                  are associated with anthropogenic land-use changes in
                  ecosystems linked to increased EIDs risks. We aimed to analyse
                  financial influence associated with EIDs risks that are
                  affected by anthropogenic land-use changes. We also aimed to
                  provide empirical assessments of such influence to help guide
                  engagements by governments, private organisations, and
                  non-governmental organisations with the financial sector to
                  advance a planetary health agenda. METHODS: For this
                  integrative analysis, we identified regions in the world where
                  there was evidence of a connection between EIDs and
                  anthropogenic land-use changes between Nov 9, 1999, and Oct
                  25, 2021, through a targeted literature review of academic
                  literature and grey literature to identify evidence of drivers
                  of anthropogenic land-use change and their association with
                  commodity production in these regions. We only included
                  publications in English that showed a connection between
                  deforestation and the production of one or more commodities.
                  Publications merely describing spatial or temporal land-use
                  change dynamics (eg, a reduction of forest or an increase of
                  palm-oil plantations) were excluded. As we were assessing
                  financial influence on corporate activities through ownership
                  specifically, we focused our analysis on publicly listed
                  companies. Equity data and data about ownership structure were
                  extracted from Orbis, a company information database. We
                  assessed financial influence by identifying financial entities
                  with the largest equity ownership, descriptively mapping
                  transboundary connections between investors and publicly
                  listed companies. FINDINGS: 227 public and private companies
                  operating in five economic sectors (ie, production of palm
                  oil, pulp and wood products, cocoa, soybeans, and beef)
                  between Dec 15, 2020, and March 8, 2021, were identified. Of
                  these 227, 99 (44\%) were publicly listed companies, with 2310
                  unique shareholders. These publicly listed companies operated
                  in six geographical regions, resulting in nine case-study
                  regions. 54 (55\%) companies with complete geographical
                  information were included in the countries network. Four
                  financial entities (ie, Dimensional, Vanguard, BlackRock, and
                  Norway's sovereign wealth fund) each had ownership in 39
                  companies or more in three of the case-study regions (ie,
                  north America, east Asia, and Europe). Four large US-based
                  asset managers (ie, Vanguard, BlackRock, T Rowe Price, and
                  State Street) were the largest owners of publicly listed
                  companies in terms of total equity size, with ownership
                  amounts for these four entities ranging from US$8 billion to
                  $21 billion. The specific patterns of cross-national ownership
                  depended on the region of interest; for example, financial
                  influence on EIDs risks that was associated with commodity
                  production in southeast and east Asia came from not only
                  global asset managers but also Malaysian, Chinese, Japanese,
                  and Korean financial entities. India, Brazil, the USA, Mexico,
                  and Argentina were the countries towards which investments
                  were most directed. INTERPRETATION: Although commodity supply
                  chains and financial markets are highly globalised, a small
                  number of investors and countries could be viewed as
                  disproportionally influential in sectors that increase EIDs
                  risks. Such financial influence could be used to develop and
                  implement effective policies to reduce ecological degradation
                  and mitigate EIDs risks and their effects on population
                  health. FUNDING: Formas and Networks of Financial Rupture-how
                  cascading changes in the climate and ecosystems could impact
                  on the financial sector.},

                  a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised
                  global concern1–3. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests
                  remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now,
                  the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress
                  from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and
                  fires, even in central and remote parts of the system1. Long
                  existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental
                  conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify
                  ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical
                  transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major
                  drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as
                  potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if
                  crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide
                  forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various
                  disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10\% to 47\% of
                  Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances
                  that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and
                  potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples
                  of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three
                  most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different
                  feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the
                  inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about
                  future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action.
                  Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will
                  depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation
                  and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts
                  to stop greenhouse gas emissions. Analyses of drivers of water
                  stress are used to predict likely trajectories of the Amazon
                  forest system and suggests potential actions that could
                  prevent system collapse.},

  abstract     = {Social scientists have increasingly turned to the experimental
                  method to understand human behaviour. One critical issue that
                  makes solving social problems difficult is scaling up the idea
                  from a small group to a larger group in more diverse
                  situations. The urgency of scaling policies impacts us every
                  day, whether it is protecting the health and safety of a
                  community or enhancing the opportunities of future
                  generations. Yet, a common result is that, when we scale up
                  ideas, most experience a ‘voltage drop’—that is, on scaling,
                  the cost–benefit profile depreciates considerably. Here I
                  argue that, to reduce voltage drops, we must optimally
                  generate policy-based evidence. Optimality requires answering
                  two crucial questions: what information should be generated
                  and in what sequence. The economics underlying the science of
                  scaling provides insights into these questions, which are in
                  some cases at odds with conventional approaches. For example,
                  there are important situations in which I advocate flipping
                  the traditional social science research model to an approach
                  that, from the beginning, produces the type of policy-based
                  evidence that the science of scaling demands. To do so, I
                  propose augmenting efficacy trials by including relevant tests
                  of scale in the original discovery process, which forces the
                  scientist to naturally start with a recognition of the big
                  picture: what information do I need to have scaling
                  confidence? To reduce voltage drops—the depreciation of the
                  cost–benefit profile when scaling up solutions to social
                  problems—sufficient policy-based evidence must be generated
                  before policymakers scale up the project.},

                  species occurrences, where records close in the geographic or
                  environmental space are removed from the modeling procedure,
                  is an approach often used to address these biases. However,
                  thinning occurrence data can also negatively affect SDM
                  performance, given that the benefits of removing spatial
                  biases might be outweighed by the detrimental effects of data
                  loss caused by this approach. We used real and virtual species
                  to evaluate how spatial and environmental thinning affected
                  different performance metrics of four SDM methods. The
                  occurrence data of virtual species were sampled randomly,
                  evenly spaced, and clustered in the geographic space to
                  simulate different types of spatial biases, and several
                  spatial and environmental thinning distances were used to thin
                  the occurrence data. Null datasets were also generated for
                  each thinning distance where we randomly removed the same
                  number of occurrences by a thinning distance and compared the
                  results of the thinned and null datasets. We found that
                  spatially or environmentally thinned occurrence data is no
                  better than randomly removing them, given that thinned
                  datasets performed similarly to null datasets. Specifically,
                  spatial and environmental thinning led to a general decrease
                  in model performances across all SDM methods. These results
                  were observed for real and virtual species, were positively
                  associated with thinning distance, and were consistent across

                  reduction technique that is known for being simple and easy to
                  interpret. Principal components are often interpreted as
                  low-dimensional patterns in high-dimensional data. However,
                  this simple interpretation of PCA relies on several unstated
                  assumptions that are difficult to satisfy. When these
                  assumptions are violated, non-oscillatory data may have
                  oscillatory principal components. Here, we show that two
                  common properties of data violate these assumptions and cause
                  oscillatory principal components: smooth-ness, and shifts in
                  time or space. These two properties implicate almost all
                  neuroscience data. We show how the oscillations that they
                  produce, which we call “phantom oscillations”, impact data
                  analysis. We also show that traditional cross-validation does
                  not detect phantom oscillations, so we suggest procedures that
                  do. Our findings are supported by a collection of mathematical
                  proofs. Collectively, our work demonstrates that patterns
                  which emerge from high-dimensional data analysis may not
                  faithfully represent the underlying data.}

               subspaces of equal density and thus hinders efficiency of
               inference as well as interpretation of obtained parameters. In
               particular, posterior averages over factor loadings become
               meaningless and only model predictions are unambiguous. Here, we
               propose a parameterization based on Householder transformations,
               which remove the rotational symmetry of the posterior.
               Furthermore, by relying on results from random matrix theory, we
               establish the parameter distribution which leaves the model
               unchanged compared to the original rotationally symmetric
               formulation. In particular, we avoid the need to compute the

                  wildlife reservoirs of plague (Yersinia pestis) now persist
                  around the world, including in the western United States.
                  Routine surveillance in this region has generated
                  comprehensive records of human cases and animal
                  seroprevalence, creating a unique opportunity to test how
                  plague reservoirs are responding to environmental change.
                  Here, we test whether animal and human data suggest that
                  plague reservoirs and spillover risk have shifted since 1950.
                  To do so, we develop a new method for detecting the impact of
                  climate change on infectious disease distributions, capable of
                  disentangling long-term trends (signal) and interannual
                  variation in both weather and sampling (noise). We find that
                  plague foci are associated with high-elevation rodent
                  communities, and soil biochemistry may play a key role in the
                  geography of long-term persistence. In addition, we find that
                  human cases are concentrated only in a small subset of endemic
                  areas, and that spillover events are driven by higher rodent
                  species richness (the amplification hypothesis) and climatic
                  anomalies (the trophic cascade hypothesis). Using our
                  detection model, we find that due to the changing climate,
                  rodent communities at high elevations have become more
                  conducive to the establishment of plague reservoirs-with
                  suitability increasing up to 40\% in some places-and that
                  spillover risk to humans at mid-elevations has increased as
                  well, although more gradually. These results highlight
                  opportunities for deeper investigation of plague ecology, the
                  value of integrative surveillance for infectious disease
                  geography, and the need for further research into ongoing

                  responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the
                  functional consequences of these interspecific interactions,
                  is central to predict community dynamics and stability.
                  Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological
                  processes by determining species interactions through a
                  two‐step process. First, ecological and life‐history traits
                  govern species distributions and abundance, and hence
                  determine species co‐occurrence and the potential for species
                  to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits
                  between co‐occurring potential interaction partners should
                  match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review
                  recent advances on predicting interactions from species
                  co‐occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring
                  trait matching. The models proposed here integrate both
                  neutral and trait‐matching constraints, while using only
                  information about known interactions, thereby overcoming
                  problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions
                  (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative
                  or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation
                  within species, such as values that vary along developmental
                  stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies
                  to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait
                  matching (e.g. predator–prey system), relaxed trait matching
                  (e.g. herbivore–plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g.
                  plant–pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species
                  traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining
                  interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in

                  and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
                  models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple
                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

                  under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC)
                  has become the common standard metric to evaluate binary
                  classifications in most scientific fields. The ROC curve has
                  true positive rate (also called sensitivity or recall) on the
                  y axis and false positive rate on the x axis, and the ROC AUC
                  can range from 0 (worst result) to 1 (perfect result). The ROC
                  AUC, however, has several flaws and drawbacks. This score is
                  generated including predictions that obtained insufficient
                  sensitivity and specificity, and moreover it does not say
                  anything about positive predictive value (also known as
                  precision) nor negative predictive value (NPV) obtained by the
                  classifier, therefore potentially generating inflated
                  overoptimistic results. Since it is common to include ROC AUC
                  alone without precision and negative predictive value, a
                  researcher might erroneously conclude that their
                  classification was successful. Furthermore, a given point in
                  the ROC space does not identify a single confusion matrix nor
                  a group of matrices sharing the same MCC value. Indeed, a
                  given (sensitivity, specificity) pair can cover a broad MCC
                  range, which casts doubts on the reliability of ROC AUC as a
                  performance measure. In contrast, the Matthews correlation
                  coefficient (MCC) generates a high score in its [Formula: see
                  text] interval only if the classifier scored a high value for
                  all the four basic rates of the confusion matrix: sensitivity,
                  specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. A high
                  MCC (for example, MCC [Formula: see text] 0.9), moreover,
                  always corresponds to a high ROC AUC, and not vice versa. In
                  this short study, we explain why the Matthews correlation
                  coefficient should replace the ROC AUC as standard statistic

  abstract     = {Abstract There are two distinct approaches to describing the
                  distributions of biomass and species in food webs: one to
                  consider them as discrete trophic levels (TLs); and the other
                  to consider them as continuous trophic positions (TPs).
                  Bridging the gap between these two perspectives presents a
                  nontrivial challenge in integrating biodiversity and food‐web
                  structure. Food network unfolding (FNU) is a technique used to
                  bridge this gap by partitioning the biomass of species into
                  integer TLs to compute three complexity indices, namely
                  vertical (DV), horizontal (DH) and range (DR) diversity (D
                  indices), through decomposition of Shannon's index H′. Using
                  FNU, the food web (a network of species with unique TPs) is
                  converted to a linear food chain (a biomass distribution at
                  discrete TLs). This enables us to expect that the unfolded
                  biomass within species decreases exponentially as the TL
                  increases. Under this condition, the mean TL value in unfolded
                  food chains is hypothesized to have an exponential
                  relationship with the vertical diversity, DV. To explore this,
                  we implemented FNU and calculated D indices for food webs
                  publicly available at EcoBase (n = 158) and calculated the
                  integrated TP (iTP), defined as the biomass‐weighted average
                  TP of a given food web. The iTP corresponds to the mean TL in
                  unfolded food chains and can be empirically measured through
                  compound‐specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA‐AA).
                  Although our analysis is biased towards marine ecosystems, we
                  revealed an exponential relationship between iTP and DV,
                  suggesting that iTP can serve as a measurable proxy for DV.
                  Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the iTP
                  observed in the total communities (total iTP) and the iTPs of
                  partial communities consisting only of species with 2.0 ≤ TP
                  r2 = 0.48), suggesting that DV can be predicted using partial
                  iTP. Our findings suggest that the net effect of species
                  diversity, excluding the effect of biomass (corresponding to
                  H′ − DV), on food‐web complexity can be revealed by combining
                  CSIA‐AA with biodiversity analysis (e.g. environmental DNA).},

               recorded temperature in history, and this is disrupting the usual
               balance of nature. The impacts of climate change on mammalian
               viral sharing patterns are likely to cascade in future emergence
               of zoonotic viruses. Among the thousands of expected viral
               sharing events, some of the highest risk zoonoses or potential
               zoonoses are likely to find new hosts. This may eventually pose a
               threat to human health. According to a new study, climate change
               will result in the emergence of new infectious diseases, through
               the spread of many new viruses among animal species that might be
               transmitted later on to humans. This phenomenon is expected to
               occur mainly in Africa and Asia, as both the continents have been
               historically renowned as hot spots for deadly disease spread from
               humans to animals or vice versa, including influenza, human
               immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola and severe acute respiratory
               syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) over the past decades. Virus
               modification may be affected through different aspects of climate
               changes such as sudden temperature changes and more frequent
               extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and droughts.
               This created a favorable breeding medium for viruses that aid in
               their resistance and emergence of infectious diseases. The aim of
               this chapter is to discuss the impact of climate change on viral
               diseases in Africa. The role of different climate components will
               be discussed on the viruses and the vectors/hosts, and then,
               examples for the impact of climate change on specific viruses
               will be presented.},

  abstract     = {Climate warming is predicted to cause large-scale extinctions,
                  particularly of ectothermic species. A striking difference
                  between tropical and temperate ectotherms is that tropical
                  species experience a mean habitat temperature that is closer
                  to the temperature at which fitness is maximized (T(opt)) and
                  an upper temperature limit for survival (T(max)) that is
                  closer to T(opt) than do temperate species. Thus, even a small
                  increase in environmental temperature could put tropical
                  ectotherms at high risk of extinction, whereas temperate
                  ectotherms have a wider temperature cushion. Although this
                  pattern is widely observed, the mechanisms that produce it are
                  not well understood. Here we develop a mathematical framework
                  to partition the temperature response of fitness into its
                  components (fecundity, mortality, and development) and test
                  model predictions with data for insects. We find that fitness
                  declines at high temperatures because the temperature
                  responses of fecundity and mortality act in opposite ways:
                  fecundity decreases with temperature when temperatures exceed
                  the optimal range, whereas mortality continues to increase.
                  The proximity of T(opt) to T(max) depends on how the
                  temperature response of development mediates the interaction
                  between fecundity and mortality. When development is highly
                  temperature sensitive, mortality exceeds reproduction only
                  after fecundity has started to decline with temperature, which
                  causes fitness to decline rapidly to zero when temperatures
                  exceed T(opt). The model correctly predicts empirically
                  observed fitness-temperature relationships in insects from
                  different latitudes. It also suggests explanations for the
                  widely reported phenological shifts in many ectotherms and the
                  latitudinal differences in fitness responses.},

                  recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population
                  surveys4to investigate whether human-caused climate change has
                  increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan
                  Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a
                  robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation,
                  consistent with expectations from previous empirical and
                  epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate
                  reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without
                  anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that
                  human-caused climate change has increased the overall
                  prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa
                  since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate
                  change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of
                  malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher
                  elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa
                  having greater increases. Under future climate change, we
                  project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the
                  eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the
                  present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide
                  average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions,
                  SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per
                  100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find
                  that limiting future global warming to below 2°C (SSP1-RCP2.6)
                  compared to∼3°C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496
                  excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east
                  Africa,per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a
                  decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of
                  global warming, and provides a template for future work

                  regression to multiple‐response variables, is widely used in
                  ecology. Because these models often involve many parameters
                  (one slope per response per predictor), they pose challenges
                  to model interpretation. Among these challenges, we lack
                  quantitative frameworks for estimating the overall importance
                  of single predictors in multi‐response regression models. Here
                  we demonstrate that commonality analysis and hierarchical
                  partitioning, widely used for both estimating predictor
                  importance and improving the interpretation of single‐response

                  prediction that combines a recommender system (linear
                  filtering) with an imputation algorithm based on low-rank
                  graph embedding. We test this method by applying it to a
                  global database of mammal-virus interactions and thus show
                  that it makes biologically plausible predictions that are
                  robust to data biases. We find that the mammalian virome is
                  under-characterized anywhere in the world. We suggest that
                  future virus discovery efforts could prioritize the Amazon
                  Basin (for its unique coevolutionary assemblages) and
                  sub-Saharan Africa (for its poorly characterized zoonotic
                  reservoirs). Graph embedding of the imputed network improves
                  predictions of human infection from viral genome features,
                  providing a shortlist of priorities for laboratory studies and
                  surveillance. Overall, our study indicates that the global
                  structure of the mammal-virus network contains a large amount
                  of information that is recoverable, and this provides new
                  insights into fundamental biology and disease emergence.},

                  in science. The present article considers some questionable
                  metascience practices (QMPs) that may threaten scientists’
                  trust in metascience. A QMP is a research practice,
                  assumption, or perspective that has been questioned by several
                  commentators as being potentially problematic for the
                  credibility of metascience and/or the science reform movement.
                  The present article reviews 10 QMPs that relate to criticism,
                  replication, bias, generalization, and the characterization of
                  science. Specifically, the following QMPs are considered: (1)
                  rejecting or ignoring self-criticism; (2) a fast ‘n’ bropen
                  scientific criticism style; (3) overplaying the role of
                  replication in science; (4) assuming a replication rate is
                  “too low” without specifying an “acceptable” rate; (5) an
                  unacknowledged metabias towards explaining the replication
                  crisis in terms of researcher bias; (6) assuming that
                  researcher bias can be reduced; (7) devaluing exploratory
                  results as more “tentative” than confirmatory results; (8)
                  presuming that QRPs are problematic research practices; (9)
                  focusing on knowledge accumulation as an index of scientific
                  progress; and (10) focusing on specific scientific methods. It
                  is stressed that only some metascientists engage in some QMPs
                  some of the time, and that these QMPs may not always be
                  problematic. Research is required to estimate the prevalence
                  and impact of QMPs. In the meantime, QMPs should be viewed as
                  invitations to ask “questions” about how we go about doing
                  metascience rather than as grounds for mistrusting the
                  credibility of metascience.},

                  roles (TIRs) who support research through specialised skills,

                  leading research projects. TIRs such as Lab Technicians,
                  Project Managers, Data Stewards, Community Managers, and
                  Research Software Engineers all play an important role in
                  ensuring the success of a research project, but are commonly
                  neglected under current reward and recognition procedures,
                  which focus on the individual academic researcher instead of
                  the teams involved. Without meaningful identification and
                  recognition of TIR contributions, we risk reinforcing the
                  conceptual and practical division between academic researchers
                  and TIRs. This situation is inequitable and detrimental to the
                  research enterprise: the limited potential for career

                  evolution of specialist TIRs and the status of these positions

                  research roles will help retain skill and expertise, and lead

                  informed decisions. Poorly supported management can have
                  detrimental, costly or irreversible impacts on the environment
                  and society. Here, we examine common issues in ecological

                  crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the
                  available data and understanding of ecological structures.
                  Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over
                  parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a
                  lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to
                  predict ecological systems' responses to management.
                  Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of
                  model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a
                  series of critical questions regarding state and control
                  variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the

                  has grown increasingly difficult as state-of-the-art
                  architectures grow more complex. Following the path of
                  traditional software engineering, machine learning engineers
                  have begun to reuse large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) and
                  fine-tune these models for downstream tasks. Prior works have
                  studied reuse practices for traditional software packages to
                  guide software engineers towards better package maintenance
                  and dependency management. We lack a similar foundation of
                  knowledge to guide behaviors in pre-trained model ecosystems.
                  In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of
                  PTM reuse. We interviewed 12 practitioners from the most
                  popular PTM ecosystem, Hugging Face, to learn the practices
                  and challenges of PTM reuse. From this data, we model the
                  decision-making process for PTM reuse. Based on the identified
                  practices, we describe useful attributes for model reuse,
                  including provenance, reproducibility, and portability. Three
                  challenges for PTM reuse are missing attributes, discrepancies
                  between claimed and actual performance, and model risks. We
                  substantiate these identified challenges with systematic
                  measurements in the Hugging Face ecosystem. Our work informs
                  future directions on optimizing deep learning ecosystems by

                  meaning of vulnerability has proved extremely difficult. On
                  the one hand, it is an increasingly formalised term that means
                  something very specific scientifically and methodologically
                  within the climate change institutions. On the other hand,
                  vulnerability is part of a colonial discursive framework of
                  risk. In this article, I show how contestations into the
                  scientific project have not sufficiently worked to address the
                  colonial geographic imaginaries that underlie the discursive
                  framework of vulnerability. I suggest that bringing together

                  feminist and decolonial scholarship, such as the
                  counternarratives of the Pacific,offers a way to resist the

                  neanderthalensis) and the question of whether or not they
                  dispersed into Southern Scandinavia, two contradictory
                  hypotheses can be identified. The first, and also the most
                  widely endorsed, hereafter, hypothesis A, argues primarily
                  that Neanderthals did not occupy regions above 55°N because of
                  1) climatic constraints and 2) dispersal barriers. The second,
                  hypothesis B, argues that they possibly occasionally dispersed
                  above 55°N, but that factors such as 1) research- and/or 2)
                  taphonomic bias are responsible for their archaeological
                  invisibility. Here, we report an evaluation of these competing
                  hypotheses. To this end, we reconstruct the environment for
                  the time period and region of interest (the Last Interglacial
                  Complex and Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia), based
                  on three lines of evidence: palaeoenvironmental reconstruction
                  combined with a novel habitat modelling approach, a review of
                  relevant archaeological localities, and a discussion of the
                  possible impacts of both research biases and the taphonomic
                  effects on the archaeological data. We focus particularly on
                  the climatic and geological explanatory factors relevant to
                  the two hypotheses. Our results are inconsistent with the
                  claim that climatic constraint and/or a lack of suitable
                  habitats can fully explain the absence of Neanderthals in
                  Southern Scandinavia during the Eemian Interglacial and Early
                  Weichselian Glaciation. We do, however, find evidence that a
                  geographic barrier may have impeded northerly migrations
                  during the Eemian. The evidence reviewed here suggests that
                  both research bias and taphonomy – consistent with hypothesis
                  B – could account for the archaeological invisibility of
                  Neanderthals in Southern Scandinavia, highlighting the need
                  for further strategic survey and/or excavation efforts in the
                  region.},

                  and the Data Conservancy project and the Purdue Data Curation
                  Profiles (Witt et al. 2009). Results: A total of 11 personas
                  were developed: five for various kinds of research scientists
                  (e.g., at different career stages and using different types of
                  data); a science data librarian; and five for secondary roles.
                  Conclusion: Personas were found to be useful for helping
                  developers and other project members to understand users and
                  their needs. The developed DataONE personas may be useful for
                  others trying to develop systems or programs for scientists
                  involved in data sharing.},

                  methods and associated algorithms are used and continue to
                  emerge. It is important to understand how different approaches
                  perform, particularly when applied to species occurrence
                  records that were not gathered in struc­tured surveys (e.g.
                  opportunistic records). This need motivated a large-scale,
                  collaborative effort, published in 2006, that aimed to create
                  objective comparisons of algorithm performance. As a
                  benchmark, and to facilitate future comparisons of approaches,
                  here we publish that dataset: point location records for 226
                  anonymized species from six regions of the world, with
                  accompanying predictor variables in raster (grid) and point
                  formats. A particularly interesting characteristic of this

                  available for evaluation alongside the presence-only species

                  can be used as a benchmark for modeling approaches and for

                  to address complex environmental issues. While the benefits of
                  team science approaches are clear, researchers often struggle
                  with its implementation, particularly for new team members.
                  The challenges of large projects often weigh on the most
                  vulnerable members of a team: trainees, including
                  undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral
                  researchers. Trainees on big projects have to navigate their
                  role on the team, with learning project policies, procedures,
                  and goals, all while also training in key scientific tasks
                  such as co-authoring papers. To address these challenges, we
                  created and participated in a project-specific, graduate-level
                  team science course. The purposes of this course were to: (1)
                  introduce students to the goals of the project, (2) build
                  trainees' understanding of how big projects operate, and (3)
                  allow trainees to explore how their research interests
                  dovetailed with the overall project. Additionally, trainees
                  received training regarding: (1) diversity, equity \&
                  inclusion, (2) giving and receiving feedback, and (3)
                  effective communication. Onboarding through the team science
                  course cultivated psychological safety and a collaborative
                  student community across disciplines and institutions. Thus,
                  we recommend a team science course for onboarding students to
                  big projects to help students establish the skills necessary
                  for collaborative research. Project-based team science classes
                  can benefit student advancement, enhance the productivity of
                  the project, and accelerate the discovery of solutions to
                  ecological issues by building community, establishing a shared
                  project vocabulary, and building a workforce with
                  collaborative skills to better answer ecological research

                  over Earth's history. Despite-or even spurred by-this growing
                  availability of resources, analytical paleobiology faces
                  deep-rooted obstacles that stem from the need for more
                  equitable access to data and best practices to guide analyses
                  of the fossil record. Recent progress has been accelerated by
                  a collective push toward more collaborative,
                  interdisciplinary, and open science, especially by
                  early-career researchers. Here, we survey four challenges
                  facing analytical paleobiology from an early-career
                  perspective: (1) accounting for biases when interpreting the
                  fossil record; (2) integrating fossil and modern biodiversity
                  data; (3) building data science skills; and (4) increasing
                  data accessibility and equity. We discuss recent efforts to
                  address each challenge, highlight persisting barriers, and
                  identify tools that have advanced analytical work. Given the
                  inherent linkages between these challenges, we encourage
                  discourse across disciplines to find common solutions. We also
                  affirm the need for systemic changes that reevaluate how we

                  processing, and modeling increased the importance of digital
                  documentation in improving research quality and impact.
                  Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive
                  text, as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic,
                  and visually appealing file that is easier to understand by
                  nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when
                  producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of
                  this tool in research publication is not common, despite its
                  potential to increase research impact and quality. For a
                  single study, the content of such documentation partially
                  overlaps with that of classical lab notebooks and that of the
                  scientific manuscript reporting the study. Therefore, to
                  minimize the amount of work required to manage all the files
                  related to these contents and optimize their production, we
                  present a starter kit to facilitate the implementation of
                  computational notebooks in the research process, including
                  publication. The kit contains the template of a computational
                  notebook integrated into a research project that employs R,
                  Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological studies, we
                  show how computational notebooks also foster the
                  implementation of principles of Open Science, such as
                  reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for
                  beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be
                  gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research
                  workflow. Our hope is that such minimalist yet effective
                  starter kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice
                  in their workflow, regardless of their computational

                  Here, through a combination of phylogenetic and
                  epidemiological models, we reconstructed the recent
                  transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons
                  in Brazil. A suitability index based on the highly
                  domesticated Aedes aegypti was able to capture the seasonality
                  of reported human infections. Spatial modeling revealed
                  spatial hotspots with both past reporting and low vaccination

                  departments, we show that women leave academia overall at
                  higher rates than men at every career age, in large part
                  because of strongly gendered attrition at lower-prestige
                  institutions, in non-STEM fields, and among tenured faculty. A
                  large-scale survey of the same faculty indicates that the
                  reasons faculty leave are gendered, even for institutions,
                  fields, and career ages in which retention rates are not.
                  Women are more likely than men to feel pushed from their jobs

                  of their inordinate taxonomic and functional diversity are
                  high niche availability associated with the diversity of host
                  plants and dense niche packing due to host partitioning among
                  herbivores. However, the relative contributions of these two
                  factors to dynamics in the diversity of herbivores throughout
                  Earth's history remain unresolved. Using fossil data on
                  herbivore-induced leaf damage from across the Cenozoic, we
                  infer quantitative bipartite interaction networks between
                  plants and functional feeding types of herbivores. We fit a

                  to understand how environmental variation influences species
                  geographical distribution. SDMs are implemented by several
                  different algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms
                  consistently lose accuracy exactly when they are needed the
                  most, that is with rare species, originating the so‐called
                  rare‐species modelling paradox. Although approaches exist to
                  tackle this problem, most notably by performing and then
                  averaging a number of bivariate models, they are usually
                  computationally intensive and were never shown to apply
                  successfully to the rarest species (i.e. with less than 20
                  geographical occurrences). Here, we present a new algorithm,
                  ENphylo, embedded in the readily‐available R package RRdtn,
                  which couples Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and
                  phylogenetic imputation to model the distribution of rare
                  species. Using the fossil record of 31 species of large
                  mammals that lived during the late Pleistocene as the source
                  data to sample from, we demonstrate ENphylo provides good SDM
                  evaluation scores, with area under the curve and Sørensen
                  Index both consistently above 0.75, True Skills Statistics
                  above 0.4 and Boyce Index above 0.5 in most cases, when just
                  10 fossil occurrences are randomly drawn from their respective
                  fossil records. ENphylo proved significantly more accurate
                  than ENFA and the ensemble of bivariate models using Maxent,
                  Generalized Linear Model and Random Forest algorithms.
                  Intriguingly, we found that randomly drawing as little as 10
                  occurrence data points per species allows ENphylo to perform
                  equally well as Maxent run using the entire fossil record of
                  these same species and data. ENphylo provides a fast and
                  accurate solution to perform species distribution modelling
                  with rare species, which will help predicting their
                  distribution in the light of climate change, and to delineate
                  how rare extinct species reacted to past climatic variation.},

                  environmental variables. While data on species presence are
                  increasingly accessible, the difficulty of confirming real
                  absences in the field often forces researchers to generate
                  them in silico. To this aim, pseudo‐absences are commonly
                  sampled randomly across the study area (i.e. the geographical
                  space). However, this introduces sample location bias (i.e.
                  the sampling is unbalanced towards the most frequent habitats
                  occurring within the geographical space) and favours class
                  overlap (i.e. overlap between environmental conditions
                  associated with species presences and pseudo‐absences) in the
                  training dataset. To mitigate this, we propose an alternative
                  methodology (i.e. the uniform approach) that systematically
                  samples pseudo‐absences within a portion of the environmental
                  space delimited by a kernel‐based filter, which seeks to
                  minimise the number of false absences included in the training
                  dataset. We simulated 50 virtual species and modelled their
                  distribution using training datasets assembled with the
                  presence points of the virtual species and pseudo‐absences
                  collected using the uniform approach and other approaches that
                  randomly sample pseudo‐absences within the geographical space.
                  We compared the predictive performance of habitat suitability
                  models and evaluated the extent of sample location bias and
                  class overlap associated with the different sampling
                  strategies. Results indicated that the uniform approach: (i)
                  effectively reduces sample location bias and class overlap;
                  (ii) provides comparable predictive performance to sampling
                  strategies carried out in the geographical space; and (iii)
                  ensures gathering pseudo‐absences adequately representing the
                  environmental conditions available across the study area. We
                  developed a set of R functions in an accompanying R package

                  collected a large dataset consisting of 2670 observations of
                  tri-trophic interactions among plants, sap-sucking aphids and
                  honeydew-collecting ants on 18 forested islands in the
                  Thousand Island Lake, China. For each island, we constructed
                  an antagonistic plant–aphid and a mutualistic aphid–ant
                  network, and tested how network specialization varied with
                  island area and isolation. We found that both networks
                  exhibited higher specialization on smaller islands, while only
                  aphid–ant networks had increased specialization on more
                  isolated islands. Variations in network specialization among
                  islands was primarily driven by species turnover, which was
                  interlinked across trophic levels as fragmentation increased
                  the specialization of both antagonistic and mutualistic
                  networks through bottom-up effects via plant and aphid
                  communities. These findings reveal that species on small and
                  isolated islands display higher specialization mainly due to
                  effects of fragmentation on species turnover, with behavioural
                  changes causing interaction rewiring playing only a minor
                  role. Our study highlights the significance of adopting a

                  Epidemiologists first analyzed wastewater to track outbreaks
                  of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based
                  epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels
                  while bypassing the difficulties and pit falls of individual
                  testing. Current approaches overlook the activity of most
                  human viruses and preclude a deeper understanding of human
                  virome community dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive
                  sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater
                  samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical
                  to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting
                  thousands of viral species or variants. Over 450 distinct
                  pathogenic viruses from 28 viral families are observed, most
                  of which have never been detected in such samples. Sequencing
                  reads of established pathogens and emerging viruses correlate

                  sequencing of 16 farmland and sediment samples taken from the
                  east and west coasts of Australia. We identified 2,562
                  putatively novel viruses across 15 orders, the vast majority
                  of which belonged to the microbe-associated
                  phylumLenarviricota. In many orders, the novel viruses
                  identified here comprised entirely new clades, such as
                  theNodamuviralesandGhabrivirales. Novel viruses also fell
                  between established genera or families, such as in
                  theCystoviridaeandPicornavirales, while highly divergent
                  lineages were identified in

                  diversity were influenced by sampling site, soil type and land

                  in our quest to understand better climate change and its
                  impacts, we first need to critically review the strengths and
                  weaknesses of local knowledge of climate change and the
                  potential complementarity with scientific knowledge. With this
                  aim, we conducted a systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of
                  published peer-reviewed documents reporting local indicators
                  of climate change (including both local observations of
                  climate change and observed impacts on the biophysical and the
                  social systems). Overall, primary data on the topic are not
                  abundant, the methodological development is incipient, and the
                  geographical extent is unbalanced. On the 98 case studies
                  documented, we recorded the mention of 746 local indicators of

                  observations of climate change are the most frequently
                  reported type of change, the rich and fine-grained knowledge

                  While the field of explainable ML has expanded in recent
                  years, much of this work has not taken real-world needs into
                  account. A majority of proposed methods are designed with
                  generic explainability goals without well-defined use cases or
                  intended end users and evaluated on simplified tasks,
                  benchmark problems/datasets, or with proxy users (e.g., Amazon
                  Mechanical Turk). We argue that these simplified evaluation
                  settings do not capture the nuances and complexities of
                  real-world applications. As a result, the applicability and
                  effectiveness of this large body of theoretical and
                  methodological work in real-world applications are unclear. In
                  this work, we take steps toward addressing this gap for the
                  domain of public policy. First, we identify the primary use
                  cases of explainable ML within public policy problems. For
                  each use case, we define the end users of explanations and the
                  specific goals the explanations have to fulfill. Finally, we
                  map existing work in explainable ML to these use cases,
                  identify gaps in established capabilities, and propose
                  research directions to fill those gaps to have a practical
                  societal impact through ML. The contribution is (a) a
                  methodology for explainable ML researchers to identify use
                  cases and develop methods targeted at them and (b) using that
                  methodology for the domain of public policy and giving an
                  example for the researchers on developing explainable ML
                  methods that result in real-world impact.},

                  exclusion of plant species by determining which plants receive
                  conspecific pollen. A key question is whether realistic
                  pollinator foraging behavior promotes coexistence or exclusion
                  of plant species. We use a simulation model to understand how
                  pollinator foraging behavior impacts the coexistence dynamics
                  of pollen-limited plants. To determine whether pollinators are
                  likely to provide a biologically important coexistence
                  mechanism, we compare our results to bee foraging data from
                  the literature and from a novel experimental analysis. Model
                  results indicate that strong specialization at the level of
                  individual foraging paths is required to promote coexistence.
                  However, few empirical studies have robustly quantified
                  within-bout specialization. Species-level data suggest that
                  foraging behavior is sufficient to permit pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence in species-poor plant communities and possibly in
                  diverse communities where congeneric plants co-occur. Our
                  experiments using bumblebees show that individual-level
                  specialization does exist, but not at levels sufficient to
                  substantially impact coexistence dynamics. The literature on
                  specialization within natural foraging paths suffers from key
                  limitations, but overall suggests that pollinator-mediated
                  coexistence should be rare in diverse plant communities.},

                  non of science, but prediction means different things to
                  different people in different contexts. I organize and explain
                  this diversity by addressing five questions. What does it mean
                  to predict something? To answer this question, I describe
                  concepts of prediction as prophecy, diagnosis, history,
                  repeatability, and fate. What are we trying to predict? Here,
                  I describe how predictions vary along several axes: general to
                  specific, qualitative to quantitative, relative to absolute,
                  point to range, and continuous to discontinuous. Where do
                  predictions come from? In this case, I focus on deductive
                  versus inductive reasoning. How do we test predictions? The
                  answer here is not straightforward and I discuss various
                  approaches and difficulties. How good are predictions? Not
                  surprisingly, it depends on what is being predicted and how we
                  judge success. Importantly, I do not espouse a “best” way to
                  approach prediction but, rather, I outline its diverse

                  structure, I evaluate here how introduced parasites might
                  reorganise food webs. Empirical evidence suggests that
                  introduced parasites alter food webs qualitatively through
                  topological changes and quantitatively through shifts in
                  trophic relationships arising from modified host phenotypic
                  traits. I argue that predicting the extent of food web
                  reorganisation is, however, difficult due to underlying
                  ecological and evolutionary processes that could provide
                  contrasting food web outcomes, including enemy release, biotic
                  resistance, and parasite spillover and spillback.
                  Nevertheless, I suggest these food web reorganisations
                  represent a further aspect of human-mediated global change

  abstract     = {Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are widely used for honey
                  production and crop pollination, raising concern for wild
                  pollinators, as honey bees may compete with wild pollinators
                  for floral resources. The first sign of competition, before
                  changes appear in wild pollinator abundance or diversity, may
                  be changes to wild pollinator interactions with plants. Such
                  changes for a community can be measured by looking at changes
                  to metrics of resource use overlap in plant-pollinator
                  interaction networks. Studies of honey bee effects on
                  plant-pollinator networks have usually not distinguished
                  whether honey bees alter wild pollinator interactions, or if
                  they merely alter total network structure by adding their own
                  interactions. To test this question, we experimentally
                  introduced honey bees to a Canadian grassland and measured
                  plant-pollinator interactions at varying distances from the
                  introduced hives. We found that honey bees increased the
                  network metrics of pollinator and plant functional
                  complementarity and decreased interaction evenness. However,
                  in networks constructed from just wild pollinator
                  interactions, honey bee abundance did not affect any of the
                  metrics calculated. Thus, all network structural changes to
                  the full network (including honey bee interactions) were due
                  only to honey bee-plant interactions, and not to honey bees
                  causing changes in wild pollinator-plant interactions. Given
                  widespread and increasing use of honey bees, it is important
                  to establish whether they affect wild pollinator communities.
                  Our results suggest that honey bees did not alter wild
                  pollinator foraging patterns in this system, even in a year
                  that was drier than the 20-year average.},

                  ecological networks in ways that have population consequences.
                  For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by
                  urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong
                  interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in
                  rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed
                  avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we
                  hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants
                  was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network
                  structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ
                  experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii)
                  was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared
                  bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control
                  forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with
                  little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities
                  of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded
                  information about nest location, and monitored nest survival.
                  For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of
                  interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation
                  resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic
                  honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of
                  interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural
                  forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival
                  increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship
                  was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest
                  overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by
                  honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network
                  shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested
                  that factors other than invasion were responsible for network
                  changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time
                  lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological
                  networks may be more challenging than anticipated.},

                  biases in scientists' choices about which species to study may
                  beget distorted knowledge bases and stagnant paradigms.
                  Disparities in biological knowledge can result from bias in
                  study species selection within a cycle of policymaking,
                  funding, and publication, all subject to implicit biases.
                  Here, we show that ornithological research in the USA and
                  Canada is biased toward birds with greater aesthetic salience
                  and those with larger breeding ranges and ranges that
                  encompass more universities. We quantified components of
                  aesthetic salience (e.g., color, pattern/contrast, body size)
                  of 293 passerines and near-passerines based on empirically
                  documented human visual preferences and investigated whether
                  these components were associated with research effort. We also
                  quantified each species' breeding range size and the number of
                  universities within that range. Accounting for phylogenetic
                  relatedness, we found that these metrics of aesthetics,
                  familiarity, and accessibility combined to explain 45\% of the
                  variation in the number of published papers about each species
                  from 1965-2020. On average, birds in the top 10\% of aesthetic
                  salience were studied 3.0X more than birds in the bottom 10\%,
                  and publication numbers were predicted most strongly by color
                  and pattern components of aesthetic salience. Birds in the top
                  10\% of breeding range size and university abundance were
                  studied 3.8X and 3.5X more often than species in the bottom
                  10\% of those categories, respectively. Species listed as
                  Endangered and those featured on journal covers have greater
                  aesthetic salience scores than other species. We discuss how
                  these biases may influence perceived relative value of species

                  fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions
                  of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling
                  and community ecology – approach this problem differently.
                  Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs)
                  to quantify the relationship between species’ and their
                  environments without considering potential biotic
                  interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to
                  focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies,
                  use co‐occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes.
                  Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM)
                  that integrates these distinct observational approaches by
                  incorporating species co‐occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs
                  estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and
                  allow decomposition of species co‐occurrence patterns into
                  components describing shared environmental responses and
                  residual patterns of co‐occurrence. We provide a general
                  description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the
                  model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two
                  case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia.
                  Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than
                  residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there
                  were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species
                  generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to
                  the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were
                  not fully described by the environmental variables included in
                  the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar
                  environmental responses but had negative residual
                  co‐occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species
                  may not form stable assemblages despite having similar
                  environmental affinities. Environmental and residual
                  correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether
                  co‐occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or
                  other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic
                  interactions), or if important predictor variables are
                  missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions
                  of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a
                  major limitation of modelling species distributions
                  independently.},

                  compositions (i.e. ecological uniqueness) is crucial to
                  understanding the mechanisms underpinning diversity patterns
                  and for effective conservation planning. Environmental
                  conditions are often sampled differentially in datasets, which
                  can lead to rarer environments having unique species
                  compositions, provided that environmental differences increase
                  compositional differences. This effect, however, will be
                  undesirable when a study aims to test the direct impact of
                  environments rather than their availability. We developed an
                  approach to reduce the effects of environmental availability
                  in ecological uniqueness analyses through calculating expected
                  pairwise compositional dissimilarities for each unique
                  environmental condition. We further used simulations to assess
                  the performance of our methods by randomly generating
                  communities from two hypothetical environments with
                  non‐overlapping species pools. Additionally, we used a dataset
                  of 50 tree communities to demonstrate how environmental
                  availability could impact relationships between environmental
                  conditions and ecological uniqueness in empirical studies. Our
                  simulations revealed that uniqueness metrics based on observed
                  values are sensitive to environmental availability, while our
                  approach correctly concluded that there were no differences
                  among environments under the unbalanced design. Our analysis
                  of tree communities produced divergent conclusions between the
                  two approaches, as increasing slope reduced ecological
                  uniqueness after controlling for their low availability in the
                  dataset only. This suggests that low environmental
                  availability inflated the ecological uniqueness of sites with
                  high slope, which opposed its direct negative effects on
                  ecological uniqueness, leading to a weak relationship based on
                  observed values. To achieve a more mechanistic understanding
                  of ecological uniqueness patterns, the effects of
                  environmental availability must be considered. We recommend
                  that studies use both uncorrected and corrected analyses to
                  identify not only the direct effects of environmental
                  conditions but also the degree to which their availability
                  influences the observed relationships between ecological
                  uniqueness and environment conditions. Our approach should be
                  most necessary and applicable in unbalanced designs, which is
                  a common characteristic in empirical studies.},

                  lead to an excess of false positives, which can reduce the
                  reproducibility of results. However, the scenarios used to
                  prove this rule tend to be unrealistic, assuming the addition
                  of unlimited extra samples to achieve statistical
                  significance, or doing so when results are not even close to
                  significant; an unlikely situation for most experiments
                  involving patient samples, cultured cells, or live animals. If
                  we were to examine some more realistic scenarios, could there
                  be any situations where N-hacking might be an acceptable
                  practice? This Essay aims to address this question, using
                  simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false
                  positives and to investigate whether this increase is still
                  relevant when using parameters based on real-life experimental
                  settings.},

               instruments, and present some illustrative studies that required
               the use of specific types of equipment. We cover instruments used
               in both terrestrial and aquatic bioacoustic studies. The ensuing
               discussions will introduce the reader to some of the commonly
               used microphones, hydrophones, amplifiers, analog-to-digital

                  obtain a desired outcome. To this end, several works have
                  proposed optimization-based methods to generate nearest

                  aegypti, has recently evolved to specialize in biting and
                  living alongside humans. It prefers human odor over the odor
                  of nonhuman animals and breeds in human-provided artificial
                  containers rather than the forest tree holes of its ancestors.
                  Here, we report one way this human specialist has adapted to
                  the distinct ecology of human environments. While eggs of the
                  ancestral subspecies rarely hatch in pure water, those of the
                  derived human specialist do so readily. We trace this novel
                  behavior to a shift in how eggs respond to dissolved oxygen,
                  low levels of which may signal food abundance. Moreover, we
                  show that while tree holes are consistently low in dissolved
                  oxygen, artificial containers often have much higher levels.
                  There is thus a concordance between the hatching behavior of
                  each subspecies and the aquatic habitat it uses in the wild.
                  We find this behavioral variation is heritable, with both
                  maternal and zygotic effects. The zygotic effect depends on
                  dissolved oxygen concentration (i.e., a genotype-environment
                  interaction, or G×E), pointing to potential changes in
                  oxygen-sensitive circuits. Together, our results suggest that
                  a shift in hatching response contributed to the pernicious
                  success of this human-specialist mosquito and illustrate how
                  animals may rapidly adapt to human-driven changes in the
                  environment.},

                  often lack suitable parametric representations to portray
                  them. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) provide a
                  way of estimating interactions non‐parametrically from
                  time‐series data. NODEs, however, are slow to fit, and
                  inferred interactions usually are not compared with the ground
                  truth. We provide a fast NODE fitting method, Bayesian neural
                  gradient matching (BNGM), which relies on interpolating time
                  series with neural networks and fitting NODEs to the
                  interpolated dynamics with Bayesian regularisation. We test
                  the accuracy of the approach by inferring ecological
                  interactions in time series generated by an ODE model with
                  known interactions. We compare these results against three
                  existing approaches for estimating ecological interactions,
                  standard NODEs, ODE models and convergent cross‐mapping (CCM).
                  We also infer interactions in experimentally replicated time
                  series of a microcosm featuring an algae, flagellate and
                  rotifer population, in the hare and lynx system, and the
                  Maizuru Bay community featuring 11 species. Our BNGM approach
                  allows us to reduce the fitting time of NODE systems to only a
                  few seconds and provides accurate estimates of ecological
                  interactions in the artificial system, as true ecological
                  interactions are recovered with minimal error. Our benchmark
                  analysis reveals that our approach is both faster and more
                  accurate than standard NODEs and parametric ODEs, while CCM
                  was found to be faster but less accurate. The analysis of the
                  replicated time series reveals that only the strongest
                  interactions are consistent across replicates, while the
                  analysis of the Maizuru community shows the strong negative
                  impact of the chameleon goby on most species of the community,
                  and a potential indirect negative effect of temperature by
                  favouring goby population growth. Overall, NODEs alleviate the
                  need for a mechanistic understanding of interactions, and BNGM

                  step availing quick NODE fitting to larger systems,
                  cross‐validation and uncertainty quantification, as well as
                  more objective estimation of interactions, and complex context

                  migration, hibernation or reproduction) should involve
                  statistical assessments of non‐uniform temporal patterns.
                  Circular statistics (e.g. Rayleigh test or Hermans‐Rasson
                  test) provide useful approaches for doing so based on the
                  number of individuals that exhibit particular activities
                  during a number of time intervals. This study used monthly
                  reproductive activity as an example to illustrate problems in
                  applying circular statistics to data when marginal totals
                  characterize experimental designs (e.g. the number of
                  reproductively active individuals per time interval depends on
                  sampling effort or sampling success). We illustrate the nature
                  of this problem by crafting four exemplar data sets and
                  developing a bootstrapping simulation procedure to overcome
                  complications that arise from the existence of marginal
                  totals. In addition, we apply circular statistics and our
                  bootstrapping simulation to empirical data on the reproductive
                  phenology of six species of Neotropical bats from the Amazon.
                  Because sampling effort or success can differ among time
                  intervals, circular statistics can produce misleading results
                  of two types: those suggesting uniform phenologies when
                  empirical patterns are markedly modal, and those suggesting
                  non‐uniform phenologies when empirical patterns are uniform.
                  The bootstrapping simulation overcomes these limitations: the
                  exemplar phenology in which the percentage of reproductively
                  active individuals is modal is appropriately identified as
                  non‐uniform based on the bootstrapping approach, and the
                  exemplar phenology in which the percentage of reproductively
                  active individuals is invariant is appropriately identified as
                  uniform based on the bootstrapping approach. The reproductive
                  phenology of each of the six empirical examples is non‐uniform
                  based on the bootstrapping approach, and this is true for bats
                  species with unimodal peaks or bimodal peaks. In addition to
                  problems with marginal totals, a review of analyses of
                  phenological patterns in ecology identified two other frequent
                  issues in the application of circular statistics: sampling
                  bias and pseudoreplication. Each of these issues and potential
                  solutions are also discussed. By providing source code for the
                  execution of the Rayleigh test and Hermans‐Rasson test, along
                  with the code for the bootstrapping simulation, we offer a
                  useful tool for assessing non‐random phenologies when marginal

                  wildfires, this approach ensures that remaining wildfires burn
                  under more extreme conditions. Here, we term this the
                  “suppression bias” and use a simulation model to highlight how
                  this bias fundamentally impacts wildfire activity, independent
                  of fuel accumulation and climate change. We illustrate how
                  attempting to suppress all wildfires necessarily means that
                  fires will burn with more severe and less diverse ecological
                  impacts, with burned area increasing at faster rates than
                  expected from fuel accumulation or climate change. Over a
                  human lifespan, the modeled impacts of the suppression bias
                  exceed those from fuel accumulation or climate change alone,
                  suggesting that suppression may exert a significant and

                  inference. These spatially explicit reconstructions can
                  subsequently be used to estimate dispersal metrics allowing to
                  unveil the dispersal dynamics and evaluate the capacity to

                  genomic sequences can however impact the accuracy of dispersal
                  insights gained through phylogeographic inference. In our
                  study, we implement a simulation framework to evaluate the
                  robustness of three dispersal metrics - a lineage dispersal
                  velocity, a diffusion coefficient, and an

                  reveals a broad range of isolation-by-distance patterns and
                  diffusion coefficients mostly reflecting the dispersal
                  capacity of the main infected host species but also, in some
                  cases, the likely signature of rapid and/or long-distance
                  dispersal events driven by human-mediated movements through
                  animal trade. Overall, our study provides key recommendations
                  for the lineage dispersal metrics to consider in future

                  viral threats to prevent future pandemics. Despite the many
                  proposed factors influencing viral diversity, the genomic
                  diversity and structure of viral communities in East Africa
                  are largely unknown. Results Using 38.3 Tb of
                  metatranscriptomic data obtained via ultradeep sequencing, we
                  screened vertebrate-associated viromes from 844 bats and 250
                  rodents from Kenya and Uganda collected from the wild. The 251
                  vertebrate-associated viral genomes of bats (212) and rodents
                  (39) revealed the vast diversity, host-related variability,
                  and high geographic specificity of viruses in East Africa.
                  Among the surveyed viral families, Coronaviridae and
                  Circoviridae showed low host specificity, high conservation of
                  replication-associated proteins, high divergence among viral
                  entry proteins, and frequent recombination. Despite major
                  dispersal limitations, recurrent mutations, cocirculation, and

                  machine learning tools. However, compiling the appropriate
                  training data set for real-world classification problems is
                  challenging because collecting the right amount of data for
                  each class is often difficult or even impossible. In such
                  cases, we can easily face the problem of imbalanced learning.
                  There are many methods in the literature for solving the
                  imbalanced learning problem, so it has become a serious
                  question how to compare the performance of the imbalanced
                  learning methods. Inadequate validation techniques can provide
                  misleading results (e.g., due to data shift), which leads to
                  the development of methods designed for imbalanced data sets,
                  such as stratified cross-validation (SCV) and distribution
                  optimally balanced SCV (DOB-SCV). Previous studies have shown
                  that higher classification performance scores (AUC) can be
                  achieved on imbalanced data sets using DOB-SCV instead of SCV.
                  We investigated the effect of the oversamplers on this
                  difference. The study was conducted on 420 data sets,
                  involving several sampling methods and the DTree, kNN, SVM,
                  and MLP classifiers. We point out that DOB-SCV often provides
                  a little higher F1 and AUC values for classification combined
                  with sampling. However, the results also prove that the
                  selection of the sampler-classifier pair is more important for
                  the classification performance than the choice between the
                  DOB-SCV and the SCV techniques.},

                  prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
                  express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
                  and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
                  boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
                  statistical models that differs fundamentally from
                  conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious
                  model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two
                  algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to
                  their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an
                  adaptive method for combining many simple models to give
                  improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be
                  understood as an additive regression model in which individual
                  terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise
                  fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important
                  advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of
                  predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have
                  no need for prior data transformation or elimination of
                  outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and
                  automatically handle interaction effects between predictors.
                  Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback
                  of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive
                  performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be
                  summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and
                  their predictive performance is superior to most traditional
                  modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a
                  number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate
                  the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a
                  distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla
                  australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
                  Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
                  effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a
                  model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a
                  tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

                  events, which have been the cause of most modern epidemics.
                  Characterising historical trends in zoonotic spillover can
                  provide insights into the expected frequency and severity of
                  future epidemics, but historical epidemiological data remains
                  largely fragmented and difficult to analyse. We utilised our
                  extensive epidemiological database to analyse a specific
                  subset of high-consequence zoonotic spillover events for
                  trends in the annual frequency and severity of outbreaks. Our
                  analysis, which excludes the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,
                  shows that the number of spillover events and reported deaths

                  outbreaks. Such efforts are needed to address this large and

                  only in abstract terms, a discourse which ignores the

                  time to engage with these practices in the context of their
                  broader role as multifaceted academics. In the context of a
                  sector that is blighted by stress, burnout, untenable
                  workloads, and hyper-competitive pressures to produce, there
                  is a clear danger that additional expectations to engage in

                  pressure on academics even further. In this article, the
                  theories of academic capitalism and workload creep are used to
                  explore how workload models currently exploit researchers by
                  mismeasuring academic labour. The specific increase in

                  those affecting economically important plants. Yet plant
                  species in cultivation represent a small and biased subset of
                  the plant kingdom. Here, we describe virus diversity and
                  abundance in 1,079 transcriptomes from species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) by analyzing
                  open-source data from the 1000 Plant Transcriptomes Initiative
                  (1KP). We identified 104 potentially novel viruses, of which
                  40\% were single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses across
                  eight orders, including members of the Hepelivirales,
                  Tymovirales, Cryppavirales, Martellivirales, and
                  Picornavirales. One-third of the newly described viruses were
                  double-stranded RNA viruses from the orders Durnavirales and
                  Ghabrivirales. The remaining were negative-sense RNA viruses
                  from the Rhabdoviridae, Aspiviridae, Yueviridae, and
                  Phenuiviridae and the newly proposed Viridisbunyaviridae. Our
                  analysis considerably expands the known host range of 13 virus
                  families to include lower plants (e.g., Benyviridae and
                  Secoviridae) and 4 virus families to include alga hosts (e.g.,
                  Tymoviridae and Chrysoviridae). More broadly, however, a
                  cophylogeny analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of
                  these families is largely driven by cross-species transmission
                  events. The discovery of the first 30-kDa movement protein in
                  a nonvascular plant suggests that the acquisition of plant
                  virus movement proteins occurred prior to the emergence of the
                  plant vascular system. Together, these data highlight that
                  numerous RNA virus families are associated with older
                  evolutionary plant lineages than previously thought and that
                  the apparent scarcity of RNA viruses found in lower plants
                  likely reflects a lack of investigation rather than their
                  absence. IMPORTANCE Our knowledge of plant viruses is mainly
                  limited to those infecting economically important host
                  species. In particular, we know little about those viruses
                  infecting basal plant lineages such as the ferns, lycophytes,
                  bryophytes, and charophytes. To expand this understanding, we
                  conducted a broad-scale viral survey of species across the
                  breadth of the plant kingdom. We found that basal plants
                  harbor a wide diversity of RNA viruses, including some that
                  are sufficiently divergent to likely compose a new virus
                  family. The basal plant virome revealed offers key insights
                  into the evolutionary history of core plant virus gene modules
                  and genome segments. More broadly, this work emphasizes that
                  the scarcity of viruses found in these species to date most
                  likely reflects the limited research in this area.},

                  process. Reconstructing the deep phylogenetic histories of
                  viruses helps identify major evolutionary transitions and
                  contextualizes the emergence of viruses in new hosts. We used
                  a combination of total RNA sequencing and transcriptome data
                  mining to extend the diversity and evolutionary history of the
                  RNA virus order Articulavirales, which includes the influenza
                  viruses. We identified instances of Articulavirales in the
                  invertebrate phylum Cnidaria (including corals), constituting
                  a novel and divergent family that we provisionally named the
                  "Cnidenomoviridae." We further extended the evolutionary
                  history of the influenza virus lineage by identifying four
                  divergent, fish-associated influenza-like viruses, thereby
                  supporting the hypothesis that fish were among the first hosts
                  of influenza viruses. In addition, we substantially expanded
                  the phylogenetic diversity of quaranjaviruses and proposed
                  that this genus be reclassified as a family-the
                  "Quaranjaviridae." Within this putative family, we identified
                  a novel arachnid-infecting genus, provisionally named
                  "Cheliceravirus." Notably, we observed a close phylogenetic
                  relationship between the Crustacea- and Chelicerata-infecting
                  "Quaranjaviridae" that is inconsistent with virus-host
                  codivergence. Together, these data suggest that the
                  Articulavirales has evolved over at least 600 million years,
                  first emerging in aquatic animals. Importantly, the evolution
                  of the Articulavirales was likely shaped by multiple
                  aquatic-terrestrial transitions and substantial host jumps,
                  some of which are still observable today.},

                  notoriously challenging. In Latin America, vampire bats have
                  been culled for decades in hopes of mitigating lethal rabies
                  infections in humans and livestock. Whether culls reduce or
                  exacerbate rabies transmission remains controversial. Using
                  Bayesian state-space models, we show that a 2-year, spatially
                  extensive bat cull in an area of exceptional rabies incidence
                  in Peru failed to reduce spillover to livestock, despite
                  reducing bat population density. Viral whole genome sequencing
                  and phylogeographic analyses further demonstrated that culling
                  before virus arrival slowed viral spatial spread, but reactive
                  culling accelerated spread, suggesting that culling-induced
                  changes in bat dispersal promoted viral invasions. Our

                  catastrophe database we find strong evidence for a demand
                  effect for adaptation to two climate-related extreme events,
                  tropical cyclones and floods. Evidence on the efficiency
                  effect is more equivocal. There are some indications that
                  adaptation in rich countries might be more efficient, but the
                  evidence is far from conclusive. The implication for research
                  is that better data, in particular on adaptation effort, need
                  to be collected to understand adaptation efficiency. In terms
                  of policy, we conclude that inclusive growth policies (which
                  boost adaptation demand) should be an important component of
                  international efforts to close the adaptation deficit.},

                  dependency of biotic interactions has increased in the last
                  decades, the use of an ecological framework involving the
                  effects of spatial scaling on species interaction networks is
                  still too limited. Generally, the few studies available in the
                  literature analyzed the landscape structure at a single level
                  or are limited to a set of a few spatial extents.
                  Additionally, the little information available in the

                  species–area relationships (i.e., combining local networks
                  into metawebs to increase the spatial sampling scales from
                  small to regional levels) and the scale of effect (i.e., the
                  spatial scale at which landscape structure best predicts a

                  variation in the species’ activity pattern in the networks’

                  the extrafloral nectary (EFN) of plants in order to test the
                  hypothesis that the temporal variation in the foraging
                  behavior of these animals affects the networks’ topology. In
                  order to assess the temporal effect on the interaction
                  networks, 24-hour collections divided in two 12-hour shifts
                  (day and night) were performed in 20 plots, thus totaling 288
                  collection hours over 6 months. The ant-plant interaction
                  networks presented similarity among the topological metrics
                  assessed throughout the day. Different ant species presented
                  distinct foraging times. Thus, two modules referring to the
                  day and night shifts emerged from the network and presented
                  specific species at each foraging shift. On the other hand,
                  the plants kept on providing the resource (active EFNs)
                  throughout the day. The results found in the current study
                  have shown that ecological networks keep their structures
                  constant; however, the ecological processes ruling these
                  networks can better respond to the effects caused, for
                  example, by the temporal variation in species’ activity.
                  Therefore, it is worth always taking into consideration the
                  importance of ecological processes at the time to analyze

                  Analyses of the rapidly expanding cache of environmental and
                  ecological data, however, require advanced statistical methods
                  to contend with complexities inherent to extremely large
                  natural data sets. Modern machine learning frameworks such as
                  gradient boosted trees efficiently identify complex ecological
                  relationships in massive data sets, which are expected to
                  result in accurate predictions of the distribution and
                  abundance of organisms in nature. However, rigorous
                  assessments of the theoretical advantages of these
                  methodologies on natural data sets are rare. Here we compare
                  the abilities of gradient boosted and linear models to
                  identify environmental features that explain observed
                  variations in the distribution and abundance of blacklegged
                  tick (Ixodes scapularis) populations in a data set collected
                  across New York State over a ten-year period. The gradient
                  boosted and linear models use similar environmental features
                  to explain tick demography, although the gradient boosted
                  models found non-linear relationships and interactions that
                  are difficult to anticipate and often impractical to identify
                  with a linear modeling framework. Further, the gradient
                  boosted models predicted the distribution and abundance of
                  ticks in years and areas beyond the training data with much
                  greater accuracy than their linear model counterparts. The
                  flexible gradient boosting framework also permitted additional
                  model types that provide practical advantages for tick
                  surveillance and public health. The results highlight the
                  potential of gradient boosted models to discover novel
                  ecological phenomena affecting pathogen demography and as a

                  of central importance, since it expresses the probability of
                  the observed data under a particular statistical model, and
                  thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of
                  parameters and to choices among different models. For simple
                  models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can
                  typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an
                  analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function
                  might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods
                  bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way,

                  inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically

                  barriers1-3. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of
                  introduced species derive from their effects on networks of
                  species interactions4,5, but we lack a quantitative
                  understanding of the impacts of introduced species on
                  ecological networks and their biogeographic patterns globally.
                  Here we address this data gap by analysing mutualistic
                  seed-dispersal interactions from 410 local networks,
                  encompassing 24,455 unique pairwise interactions between 1,631
                  animal and 3,208 plant species. We show that species
                  introductions reduce biogeographic compartmentalization of the
                  global meta-network, in which nodes are species and links are
                  interactions observed within any local network. This
                  homogenizing effect extends across spatial scales, decreasing
                  beta diversity among local networks and modularity within
                  networks. The prevalence of introduced interactions is
                  directly related to human environmental modifications and is
                  accelerating, having increased sevenfold over the past 75
                  years. These dynamics alter the coevolutionary environments
                  that mutualists experience6, and we find that introduced
                  species disproportionately interact with other introduced
                  species. These processes are likely to amplify biotic
                  homogenization in future ecosystems7 and may reduce the
                  resilience of ecosystems by allowing perturbations to
                  propagate more quickly and exposing disparate ecosystems to
                  similar drivers. Our results highlight the importance of
                  managing the increasing homogenization of ecological

                  In the past 10 years, numerous studies have reported that – in
                  many contexts – generalist species are “replacing” specialist
                  species. We review recent research on the concept of the
                  ecological niche and species specialization, and conclude that
                  (1) the observed worldwide decline in specialist species is
                  predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause
                  “functional homogenization” of biodiversity, and (3) such
                  homogenization may be used to measure the impact of
                  disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community
                  level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as
                  well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and
                  services. We propose community‐level specialization as an

                  efforts to effectively guide conservation actions, knowing the
                  limit of predictability is pivotal. In this study, we provide
                  realistic expectations about the enterprise of predicting
                  changes in ecological and evolutionary observations through
                  time. We begin with an intuitive explanation of predictability
                  (that is, the extent to which predictions are possible)
                  employing an easy-to-use metric, predictive powerPP(t). To
                  illustrate the challenge of forecasting, we then show that
                  among insects, birds, fishes, and mammals (i) 50\% of the
                  populations are predictable at most one year in advance, and
                  (ii) the median one-year-ahead predictive power corresponds to
                  a sobering predictionR2of approximately 20\%. Nonetheless,
                  predictability is not an immutable property of ecological
                  systems. For example, different harvesting strategies can
                  impact the predictability of exploited populations to varying
                  degrees. Moreover, considering multivariate time series,
                  incorporating explanatory variables or accounting for time
                  trends (environmental forcing) can enhance predictability. To
                  effectively address the urgent challenge of biodiversity loss,
                  researchers and practitioners must be aware of the predictive
                  information within the available data and explore efficient

                  genotypic traits of an organism related to reproduction.
                  However, these traits-gamete type, chromosomal inheritance,
                  physiology, morphology, behavior, etc.-are not necessarily
                  coupled, and the rhetorical collapse of variation into a
                  single term elides much of the complexity inherent in sexual
                  phenotypes. We argue that consideration of "sex" as a
                  constructed category operating at multiple biological levels
                  opens up new avenues for inquiry in our study of biological
                  variation. We apply this framework to three case studies that
                  illustrate the diversity of sex variation, from decoupling
                  sexual phenotypes to the evolutionary and ecological
                  consequences of intrasexual polymorphisms. We argue that
                  instead of assuming binary sex in these systems, some may be
                  better categorized as multivariate and nonbinary. Finally, we
                  conduct a meta-analysis of terms used to describe diversity in
                  sexual phenotypes in the scientific literature to highlight
                  how a multivariate model of sex can clarify, rather than
                  cloud, studies of sexual diversity within and across species.
                  We argue that such an expanded framework of "sex" better
                  equips us to understand evolutionary processes, and that as
                  biologists, it is incumbent upon us to push back against

                  populations can strongly impact the spread of endemic
                  pathogens. In plants, recent work has shown that
                  within-population variation in resistance can also affect the
                  transmission of foreign spillover pathogens if that resistance
                  is general. However, most hosts also possess specific
                  resistance mechanisms that provide strong defenses against
                  coevolved endemic pathogens. Here we use a modeling approach
                  to ask how antagonistic coevolution between hosts and their
                  endemic pathogen at the specific resistance locus can affect
                  the frequency of general resistance, and therefore a host’s
                  vulnerability to foreign pathogens. We develop a two-locus
                  model with variable recombination that incorporates both
                  general resistance (effective against all pathogens) and
                  specific resistance (effective against endemic pathogens
                  only). With coevolution, when pathogens can evolve to evade
                  specific resistance, we find that the regions where general
                  resistance can evolve are greatly expanded, decreasing the
                  risk of foreign pathogen invasion. Furthermore, coevolution
                  greatly expands the conditions that maintain polymorphisms at
                  both resistance loci, thereby driving greater genetic
                  diversity within host populations. This genetic diversity
                  often leads to positive correlations between host resistance
                  to foreign and endemic pathogens, similar to those observed in
                  natural populations. However, if resistance loci become
                  linked, the resistance correlations can shift to negative. If
                  we include a third linkage-modifying locus in our model, we
                  find that selection often favors complete linkage. Our model
                  demonstrates how coevolutionary dynamics with an endemic
                  pathogen can mold the resistance structure of host populations
                  in ways that affect its susceptibility to foreign pathogen
                  spillovers, and that the nature of these outcomes depends on
                  resistance costs, as well as the degree of linkage between
                  resistance genes.},

                  association data, which underpin viral macroecology and
                  zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous
                  data portals. In the present article, we propose that
                  synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to
                  characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory

                  these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery

               contributors theorise and conceptualise this fast-emerging field
               and present case studies that illustrate the challenges and
               opportunities involved. These range from indigenous communities
               grappling with issues of identity, governance and development, to
               national governments and NGOs seeking to formulate a response to
               indigenous demands for data ownership. While the book is focused
               on the CANZUS states of Canada, Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand
               and the United States, much of the content and discussion will be
               of interest and practical value to a broader global audience. ‘A
               debate-shaping book … it speaks to a fast-emerging field; it has
               a lot of important things to say; and the timing is right.’ —

               Native Nations Institute, University of Arizona. ‘The effort … in
               this book to theorise and conceptualise data sovereignty and its
               links to the realisation of the rights of indigenous peoples is
               pioneering and laudable.’ — Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special

                  conservation and scientific research. Here, the openness of
                  biodiversity observation data that are contributed to the
                  Global Biodiversity Information Facility is examined by the
                  data provider. Contrary to what many people assume, data sets
                  from volunteers are among the most restrictive in how they can
                  be used. Policy implications. The assumption that voluntary
                  data collection leads to data sharing does not recognize the
                  wishes and motivations of those who collect data, nor does it
                  respect the crucial contributions of these data to long‐term
                  monitoring of biodiversity trends. To improve data openness,
                  citizen scientists should be recognized in ways that
                  correspond with their motivations. Furthermore, organizations
                  that manage these data should make their data sharing policies

                  Vector competence experiments help determine the

                  these experiments are often conducted in real time during

                  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
                  (MERS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we examine

                  find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of
                  risk that are distinct from the hotspots and coldspots of host
                  richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a

                  monetary terms, but this raises ethical issues. Here we
                  express them in terms of numbers of people left outside the
                  ‘human climate niche’—defined as the historically highly
                  conserved distribution of relative human population density
                  with respect to mean annual temperature. We show that climate
                  change has already put ~9\% of people (>600 million) outside
                  this niche. By end-of-century (2080–2100), current policies
                  leading to around 2.7 °C global warming could leave one-third
                  (22–39\%) of people outside the niche. Reducing global warming
                  from 2.7 to 1.5 °C results in a ~5-fold decrease in the
                  population exposed to unprecedented heat (mean annual
                  temperature ≥29 °C). The lifetime emissions of ~3.5 global
                  average citizens today (or ~1.2 average US citizens) expose
                  one future person to unprecedented heat by end-of-century.
                  That person comes from a place where emissions today are
                  around half of the global average. These results highlight the

                  self-service. This shift to the way that a business engages IT
                  services creates new challenges including regulating how
                  internal business units purchase cloud services. How does a
                  business assess cloud providers services for security,
                  privacy, and service levels? The purpose of this study is to
                  develop an instrument for evaluating a cloud provider's
                  transparency of security, privacy, and service level
                  competencies via its self-service web portals and web
                  publications, and then to empirically evaluate cloud service
                  providers to measure how transparent by using the instrument.},

                  new modes of production involving cooperation and
                  collaboration amongst peers (peer-production). In contrast
                  with traditional models of production oriented towards the
                  maximization of profits, these alternative modes of production
                  are, more often than not, oriented towards the maximization of
                  the common good. To ensure that content will always remain
                  available to the public, the output of production is often
                  released under a specific regime that prevents anyone from
                  subsequently turning it into a commodity (the regime of
                  information commons). While this might reduce the likelihood
                  of commodification, information commons can nonetheless be
                  exploited by the market economy. Indeed, since they have been
                  made available for use by anyone, large online service
                  providers can indirectly benefit from the commons by capturing
                  the value derived from it. While this is not a problem per se,
                  problems arise when the exploitation of the commons by one
                  agent is likely to preclude others from doing the same—often
                  as a result of commodification. This is especially true in the
                  context of cloud computing, where the content holder has
                  become as powerful as, if not more powerful than the copyright
                  owner. Nowadays, regardless of their legal status, information
                  commons are increasingly controlled by large corporations who
                  can precisely define the manner in which they can be used or
                  accessed. Digital communities need to be aware of these risks.
                  This Article proposes a theoretical and normative exploration
                  of these issues based on an analysis of recent trends in cloud
                  computing. It argues that, in order to reduce the likelihood
                  of commodification but still benefit from the advantages
                  offered by cloud computing, digital communities should rely on
                  decentralized platforms based on peer-to-peer architectures,
                  thereby escaping from the centralized control of large service
                  providers while nonetheless preserving the autonomy of the
                  commons they produce.},

                  state was proposed in the 1970s by James Lovelock, who
                  conjectured that life plays a self-regulatory role on a
                  planetary-level scale. A formal approach to such hypothesis
                  was presented afterwards under a toy model known as the
                  Daisyworld. The model showed how such life-geosphere
                  homeostasis was an emergent property of the system, where two
                  species with different properties adjusted their populations
                  to the changing external environment. So far, this ideal world
                  exists only as a mathematical or computational construct, but
                  it would be desirable to have a real, biological
                  implementation of Lovelock’s picture beyond our one biosphere.
                  Inspired by the exploration of synthetic ecosystems using
                  genetic engineering and recent cell factory designs, here we
                  propose a possible implementation for a microbial Daisyworld.
                  This includes: (i) an explicit proposal for an engineered
                  design of a two-strain consortia, using pH as the external,
                  abiotic control parameter and (ii) several theoretical and
                  computational case studies including two, three and multiple
                  species assemblies. The special alternative implementations
                  and their implications in other synthetic biology scenarios,

                  variation. However, a common problem is that the available
                  time-series are of different lengths. Here, we present a
                  general approach for studying the dynamic structure of such
                  interactions. Specifically, we analyse the recruitment of the
                  world's largest cod stock, the Northeast Arctic cod. Studies
                  based on data starting in the 1970-1980s indicate that this
                  stock is affected by temperature through a variety of
                  pathways. However, the value of such studies is somewhat
                  limited by the fact that they are based on a quite specific
                  ecological and climatic situation. Recently, this stock has
                  consisted of fairly young fish and the spawning stock has
                  consisted of relatively few age groups. In this study, we
                  develop a model for the effect of capelin (the cod's main
                  prey) and herring on cod recruitment since 1973. Based on this
                  model, we analyse data on cod, herring and temperature going
                  back to 1921 and find that food-web effects explain a
                  significant part of the cod recruitment variation back to
                  around 1950.},

  abstract     = {The architecture of mutualistic networks facilitates
                  coexistence of individual participants by minimizing
                  competition relative to facilitation. However, it is not known
                  whether this benefit is received by each participant node in
                  proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence.
                  This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced
                  by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by
                  applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an
                  ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here
                  we report two main results. First, nodes contribute
                  heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the
                  network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a
                  strong contributor tends to decrease overall network
                  persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor.
                  Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not
                  gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes
                  most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of
                  these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a
                  15-year time series of the interactions between designer and
                  contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As
                  with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability
                  decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases.
                  Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study
                  of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially
                  address questions about the impact of invasive species in
                  ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

                  origin present a critical threat to global population health.
                  As accelerating globalisation makes epidemics and pandemics
                  more difficult to contain, there is a need for effective
                  preventive interventions that reduce the risk of zoonotic
                  spillover events. Public policies can play a key role in
                  preventing spillover events. The aim of this review is to
                  identify and describe evaluations of public policies that
                  target the determinants of zoonotic spillover. Our approach is
                  informed by a One Health perspective, acknowledging the
                  inter-connectedness of human, animal and environmental health.
                  Methods In this systematic scoping review, we searched
                  Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021
                  using search terms combining animal health and the
                  animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and
                  zoonoses. We screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and
                  reported our process in line with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We
                  also searched relevant organisations’ websites for evaluations
                  published in the grey literature. All evaluations of public
                  policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events were
                  eligible for inclusion. We summarised key data from each
                  study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway. Results
                  Our review found 95 publications evaluating 111 policies. We
                  identified 27 unique policy options including habitat
                  protection; trade regulations; border control and quarantine
                  procedures; farm and market biosecurity measures; public
                  information campaigns; and vaccination programmes, as well as
                  multi-component programmes. These were implemented by many
                  sectors, highlighting the cross-sectoral nature of zoonotic
                  spillover prevention. Reports emphasised the importance of
                  surveillance data in both guiding prevention efforts and
                  enabling policy evaluation, as well as the importance of
                  industry and private sector actors in implementing many of
                  these policies. Thoughtful engagement with stakeholders
                  ranging from subsistence hunters and farmers to industrial
                  animal agriculture operations is key for policy success in
                  this area. Conclusion This review outlines the state of the
                  evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic
                  spillover in order to guide policy decision-making and focus
                  research efforts. Since we found that most of the existing
                  policy evaluations target ‘downstream’ determinants,
                  additional research could focus on evaluating policies
                  targeting ‘upstream’ determinants of zoonotic spillover, such
                  as land use change, and policies impacting infection intensity
                  and pathogen shedding in animal populations, such as those
                  targeting animal welfare.},

  abstract     = {Summary Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which
                  insects, particularly bees, play an important role for the
                  reproduction of most angiosperms. Currently, this service is
                  considered under threat due to reported bee declines.
                  Moderately urbanised areas could be important for pollinators
                  and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and natural
                  systems, they are poorly studied. Here, we investigated the
                  relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic
                  land use across an agricultural to urban gradient for local
                  plant and flying insect communities. We quantified local
                  flower visitor networks and related network architecture to
                  these local and landscape factors using structural equation
                  modelling. Flower visitor network architecture is often
                  assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to
                  pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator‐dependent
                  plant species. Overall, local land use markedly influenced
                  plant and flying insect communities. Flower richness and bee
                  richness were higher in urban compared to agricultural areas.
                  Flower visitor network metrics (e.g. linkage density)
                  increased with the proportion of urban area surrounding a
                  site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower
                  visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher
                  number of plant species, likely a consequence of higher urban
                  flowering plant richness. However, urban bees also visited a
                  lower proportion of the available flowering plants (higher
                  specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density, network
                  specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related
                  to pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather,
                  it was the proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance
                  and bee richness that were positively related to pollination.
                  Our findings show strong effects of local land use on plant
                  and flying insect communities and flower visitor interaction
                  networks. We observed increased overall visitation rates and
                  pollination services to our experimental plants in urban
                  compared to agricultural areas, despite increased urban flower
                  visitor generality. Indeed, flower visitor network metrics
                  were a poor proxy of provision of the ecosystem service of
                  pollination. Nevertheless, our results point to potential
                  facilitating effects of diverse urban floral and bee
                  communities for pollination. A lay summary is available for

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and
                  monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses.
                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of
                  prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.},

                  (61\%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between
                  humans and animals, and 175 pathogenic species are associated
                  with diseases considered to be 'emerging'. We test the

                  events, is of global concern and has the potential to cause
                  significant harm to society, as recently demonstrated by
                  COVID-19. More than 70\% of the 400 infectious diseases that
                  emerged in the past five decades have a zoonotic origin,
                  including all recent pandemics. There have been several
                  approaches used to predict the risk of spillover through some
                  of the known or suspected infectious disease emergence
                  drivers, largely using correlative approaches. Here, we
                  predict the spatial distribution of spillover risk by
                  approximating general transmission through animal and human
                  interactions. These mass action interactions are approximated
                  through the multiplication of the spatial distribution of
                  zoonotic viral diversity and human population density.
                  Although our results indicate higher risk in regions along the
                  equator and in Southeast Asia where both viral diversity and
                  human population density are high, it should be noted that
                  this is primarily a conceptual exercise. We compared our
                  spillover risk map to key factors, including the model inputs
                  of zoonotic viral diversity estimate map, human population
                  density map, and the spatial distribution of species richness.
                  Despite the limitations of this approach, this viral spillover
                  map is a step towards developing a more comprehensive
                  spillover risk prediction system to inform global monitoring.},

                  It predicts hundreds of weather variables, over 10 days at

                  significantly outperforms the most accurate operational
                  deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets,

                  usually focus on abiotic factors only. We propose an

                  data and statistical models to understand the distribution of
                  species and their abundances together with the underlying
                  community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with
                  21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially
                  nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's
                  performance and that the spatial variations of species
                  presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by
                  different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic,
                  dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new

                  continents at the end of the Pleistocene, between 50,000 and
                  10,000 years ago. Besides the loss in species diversity and
                  the truncation of body mass distributions, those extinctions
                  were even more impactful to interaction diversity. Along with
                  each extinction, dozens of ecological interactions were lost,
                  reorganizing species interaction networks, which attained
                  species-poor configurations with low functional redundancy.
                  Extinctions of most large herbivores impacted energy flow and
                  the rates of nutrient cycling, reconfiguring ecosystem-level
                  networks. Because large mammals have high mobility, their loss
                  also shortened seed-dispersal distance and reduced nutrient
                  diffusivity, disrupting spatial networks. This review examines
                  the recent advances in understanding how different types of
                  ecological networks have been restructured by megafaunal
                  extinctions and how this reorganization affected ecosystem
                  functions. ▪ Megafaunal extinctions resulted in the loss of
                  multiple ecological interactions in terrestrial systems. ▪
                  Interaction loss reshaped different types of ecological
                  networks including food webs and spatial networks. ▪ The
                  reorganization of ecological networks changed how terrestrial
                  ecosystems are structured and function. Expected final online

                  are not able to populate arbitrary complex nested knowledge
                  schemas. Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and
                  Recursive Extraction of Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge
                  Extraction approach that relies on the ability of Large
                  Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL) and
                  general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and
                  return information conforming to a specified schema. Given a
                  detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text,
                  SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against
                  GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided
                  schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to
                  provide identifiers for all matched elements. We present
                  examples of use of SPIRES in different domains, including
                  extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling
                  pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and
                  chemical to disease causation graphs. Current SPIRES accuracy
                  is comparable to the mid-range of existing Relation Extraction
                  (RE) methods, but has the advantage of easy customization,
                  flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks
                  in the absence of any training data. This method supports a
                  general strategy of leveraging the language interpreting
                  capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases, assisting
                  manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting
                  validation with publicly-available databases and ontologies
                  external to the LLM. SPIRES is available as part of the open
                  source OntoGPT package: https://github.com/

                  cameras, from drones to individual phones, are increasingly
                  abundant sources of biological information. There is an
                  explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly
                  computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant
                  information from images for science and conservation. Yet most
                  of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task
                  and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions,
                  contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal
                  biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach
                  this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and
                  most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then
                  develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life,
                  leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by
                  TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of
                  plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of
                  rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark
                  our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification
                  tasks, and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially
                  outperforms existing baselines (by 17\% to 20\% absolute).
                  Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a

                  shedding light on its strong generalizability. Our code,

                  used to track changes in biotic and abiotic variables.
                  Information can be extracted from the properties of time
                  series for tasks such as classification (e.g., assigning
                  species to individual bird calls); clustering (e.g.,
                  clustering similar responses in population dynamics to abrupt
                  changes in the environment or management interventions);
                  prediction (e.g., accuracy of model predictions to original
                  time series data); and anomaly detection (e.g., detecting
                  possible catastrophic events from population time series).
                  These common tasks in ecological research all rely on the
                  notion of (dis-) similarity, which can be determined using
                  distance measures. A plethora of distance measures have been
                  described, predominantly in the computer and information
                  sciences, but many have not been introduced to ecologists.
                  Furthermore, little is known about how to select appropriate
                  distance measures for time-series-related tasks. Therefore,
                  many potential applications remain unexplored. Here, we
                  describe 16 properties of distance measures that are likely to
                  be of importance to a variety of ecological questions
                  involving time series. We then test 42 distance measures for
                  each property and use the results to develop an objective
                  method to select appropriate distance measures for any task
                  and ecological dataset. We demonstrate our selection method by
                  applying it to a set of real-world data on breeding bird
                  populations in the UK and discuss other potential applications
                  for distance measures, along with associated technical issues
                  common in ecology. Our real-world population trends exhibit a
                  common challenge for time series comparisons: a high level of
                  stochasticity. We demonstrate two different ways of overcoming
                  this challenge, first by selecting distance measures with
                  properties that make them well suited to comparing noisy time
                  series and second by applying a smoothing algorithm before
                  selecting appropriate distance measures. In both cases, the
                  distance measures chosen through our selection method are not
                  only fit-for-purpose but are consistent in their rankings of
                  the population trends. The results of our study should lead to
                  an improved understanding of, and greater scope for, the use
                  of distance measures for comparing ecological time series and
                  help us answer new ecological questions.},

                  using appropriate statistical methods. Some of these methods
                  are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas
                  others are recent, including the methods of temporal
                  eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration

                  of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources. In many
                  public health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert
                  Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of public health agents
                  sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect
                  relevant events. This media screening is one important part of
                  event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles,
                  discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a
                  database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also
                  to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it
                  describes relevant, we developed a natural language processing
                  framework for automated information extraction and relevance
                  scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at
                  the RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and
                  automatically extracted the articles' key data: disease,
                  country, date, and confirmed-case count. For this, we
                  performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an
                  open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many
                  different possibilities for each. We extracted the key country
                  and disease using a heuristic with good results. We trained a
                  naive Bayes classifier to find the key date and confirmed-case
                  count, using the RKI's EBS database as labels which performed
                  modestly. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes
                  to which any article might belong: The article is relevant if
                  it is in the EBS database and irrelevant otherwise. We
                  compared the performance of different classifiers, using
                  bag-of-words, document and word embeddings. The best
                  classifier, a logistic regression, achieved a sensitivity of
                  0.82 and an index balanced accuracy of 0.61. Finally, we
                  integrated these functionalities into a web application called
                  EventEpi where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and
                  put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or
                  text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the
                  database. Each of these steps could be improved, in particular
                  with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning
                  algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well
                  and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS.

                  the body size in lineages. Over the last decades, two schools
                  of thought have fueled a debate on the applicability of Cope’s
                  rule by reporting empirical evidence, respectively, for and
                  against Cope’s rule. The apparent contradictions thus
                  documented highlight the need for a comprehensive
                  process-based synthesis through which both positions of this
                  debate can be understood and reconciled. Here, we use a
                  process-based community-evolution model to investigate the
                  eco-evolutionary emergence of Cope’s rule. We report three
                  characteristic macroevolutionary patterns, of which only two
                  are consistent with Cope’s rule. First, we find that Cope’s
                  rule applies when species interactions solely depend on
                  relative differences in body size and the risk of lineage
                  extinction is low. Second, in environments with higher risk of
                  lineage extinction, the recurrent evolutionary elimination of
                  top predators induces cyclic evolution toward larger body
                  sizes, according to a macroevolutionary pattern we call the
                  recurrent Cope’s rule. Third, when interactions between
                  species are determined not only by their body sizes but also
                  by their ecological niches, the recurrent Cope’s rule may get
                  inverted, leading to cyclic evolution toward smaller body
                  sizes. This recurrent inverse Cope’s rule is characterized by
                  highly dynamic community evolution, involving the
                  diversification of species with large body sizes and the
                  extinction of species with small body sizes. To our knowledge,
                  these results provide the first theoretical foundation for
                  reconciling the contrasting empirical evidence reported on
                  body-size evolution.},

                  Rather, our goal is to provide more concrete and actionable

                  run, and interpret ML algorithms to predict the taxa or genes
                  associated with particular sample categories or environmental
                  gradients of interest. Such microbial data often have unique

                  that the ideal instructional sequence to reduce essentialism,
                  avoid colorblindness, and increase constructionism is to
                  introduce students to the models of Mendelian genetics and
                  then move beyond these models and highlight their limitations

                  This work demonstrates that a genetics education that explores

  abstract     = {Urban ecosystems are rapidly expanding throughout the world,
                  but how urban growth affects the evolutionary ecology of
                  species living in urban areas remains largely unknown. Urban
                  ecology has advanced our understanding of how the development
                  of cities and towns change environmental conditions and alter
                  ecological processes and patterns. However, despite decades of
                  research in urban ecology, the extent to which urbanization
                  influences evolutionary and eco-evolutionary change has
                  received little attention. The nascent field of urban
                  evolutionary ecology seeks to understand how urbanization
                  affects the evolution of populations, and how those
                  evolutionary changes in turn influence the ecological dynamics
                  of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Following a brief
                  history of this emerging field, this Perspective article
                  provides a research agenda and roadmap for future research
                  aimed at advancing our understanding of the interplay between
                  ecology and evolution of urban-dwelling organisms. We identify
                  six key questions that, if addressed, would significantly
                  increase our understanding of how urbanization influences
                  evolutionary processes. These questions consider how
                  urbanization affects nonadaptive evolution, natural selection,
                  and convergent evolution, in addition to the role of urban
                  environmental heterogeneity on species evolution, and the
                  roles of phenotypic plasticity versus adaptation on species'
                  abundance in cities. Our final question examines the impact of
                  urbanization on evolutionary diversification. For each of
                  these six questions, we suggest avenues for future research
                  that will help advance the field of urban evolutionary
                  ecology. Lastly, we highlight the importance of integrating
                  urban evolutionary ecology into urban planning, conservation
                  practice, pest management, and public engagement.},

                  of bats, and therefore the transmission dynamics of viruses.
                  Within bat roosts the density and contact rate among
                  individuals increase and may facilitate the transmission of
                  bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Landscape components supporting
                  larger bat populations may thus lead to higher CoVs
                  prevalence, as the number of roosts and/or roost size are
                  likely to be higher. Hence, relationships between landscape
                  composition and the presence of CoVs are expected to exist. To
                  increase our understanding of the spread and shedding of
                  coronaviruses in bat populations we studied the relationships
                  between landscape composition and CoVs prevalence in the
                  species Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus nathusii.
                  Faecal samples were collected across The Netherlands, and were
                  screened to detect the presence of CoV RNA. Coordinates were
                  recorded for all faecal samples, so that landscape attributes
                  could be quantified. Using a backward selection procedure on
                  the basis of AIC, the landscape variables that best explained
                  the presence of CoVs were selected in the final model. Results
                  suggested that relationships between landscape composition and
                  CoVs were likely associated with optimal foraging
                  opportunities in both species, e.g. nearby water in P.
                  nathusii or in areas with more grassland situated far away
                  from forests for P. pipistrellus. Surprisingly, we found no
                  positive association between built-up cover (where roosts are
                  frequently found) and the presence of bat-CoVs for both
                  species. We also show that samples collected from large bat
                  roosts, such as maternity colonies, substantially increased
                  the probability of finding CoVs in P. pipistrellus.
                  Interestingly, while maternity colonies of P. nathusii are
                  rarely present in The Netherlands, CoVs prevalence was similar
                  in both species, suggesting that other mechanisms besides
                  roost size, participate in the transmission of bat-CoVs. We
                  encourage further studies to quantify bat roosts and colony
                  networks over the different landscape compositions to better
                  understand the ecological mechanisms involved in the
                  transmission of bat-CoVs.},

                  reservoir of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs). In West Africa,

                  and six families of insectivorous and frugivorous bats across
                  the country, for the presence of coronaviruses. We found CoVs
                  in 35 (11\%) of the tested bats—in three insectivorous bat
                  species and five fruit bat species that were mostly captured
                  close to human habitat. Positivity rates varied from 5.7\% to
                  100\%, depending on bat species. A wide diversity of alpha and
                  beta coronaviruses was found across the country, including
                  three sequences belonging to SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs subgenera

                  From hunter-gatherers through to Neolithic societies-and
                  particularly in contemporary industrialised countries-humans
                  have (voluntarily or involuntarily) provided other animals
                  with food, often with a high spatio-temporal predictability.
                  Nowadays, as much as 30-40\% of all food produced in Earth is
                  wasted. We argue here that predictable anthropogenic food
                  subsidies (PAFS) provided historically by humans to animals
                  has shaped many communities and ecosystems as we see them
                  nowadays. PAFS improve individual fitness triggering
                  population increases of opportunistic species, which may
                  affect communities, food webs and ecosystems by altering
                  processes such as competition, predator-prey interactions and
                  nutrient transfer between biotopes and ecosystems. We also
                  show that PAFS decrease temporal population variability,
                  increase resilience of opportunistic species and reduce
                  community diversity. Recent environmental policies, such as
                  the regulation of dumps or the ban of fishing discards,
                  constitute natural experiments that should improve our
                  understanding of the role of food supply in a range of
                  ecological and evolutionary processes at the ecosystem level.

                  encapsulate the overall 'stability' of the system. Many

                  Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
                  Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological
                  stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to
                  stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot
                  measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of
                  theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the

                  diversity and continue to pose a pandemic threat to humans.
                  They were the source of the most recent influenza pandemic,
                  and since 2010, novel swine viruses have spilled over into
                  humans more than 400 times in the United States. Although
                  these zoonotic infections generally result in mild illness
                  with limited onward human transmission, the potential for
                  sustained transmission of an emerging influenza virus between
                  individuals due to lack of population level immunity is of
                  great concern. Compiling the literature on pandemic threat
                  assessment, we established a pipeline to characterize and
                  triage influenza viruses for their pandemic risk and examined
                  the pandemic potential of two widespread swine origin viruses.
                  Our analysis revealed that a panel of human sera collected
                  from healthy adults in 2020 has no cross-reactive neutralizing
                  antibodies against an α-H1 clade strain but do against a γ-H1
                  clade strain. Swine H1N2 virus from the α-H1 clade (α-swH1N2)
                  replicated efficiently in human airway cultures and exhibited
                  phenotypic signatures similar to the human H1N1 pandemic
                  strain from 2009 (H1N1pdm09). Furthermore, α-swH1N2 was
                  capable of efficient airborne transmission to both naïve
                  ferrets and ferrets with prior seasonal influenza immunity.
                  Ferrets with H1N1pdm09 pre-existing immunity had reduced
                  α-swH1N2 viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract and
                  cleared the infection faster. Despite this, H1N1pdm09-immune
                  ferrets that became infected via the air could still onward
                  transmit α-swH1N2 with an efficiency of 50\%. Taken together,
                  these results indicate that this α-swH1N2 strain has a higher
                  pandemic potential, but a moderate level of impact since there
                  is reduced replication fitness in animals with prior immunity.},

                  epidemic to be directly estimated from sampled pathogen genome
                  sequences. By using phylogenetic history to correct for
                  spatial autocorrelation, we illustrate how a fundamental
                  spatial variable, the diffusion coefficient, can be estimated
                  using robust nonparametric statistics, and how heterogeneity
                  in dispersal can be readily quantified. We apply this
                  framework to the spread of the West Nile virus across North
                  America, an important recent instance of spatial invasion by
                  an emerging infectious disease. We demonstrate that the
                  dispersal of West Nile virus is greater and far more variable
                  than previously measured, such that its dissemination was
                  critically determined by rare, long-range movements that are
                  unlikely to be discerned during field observations. Our

                  previous models of the epidemic have substantially
                  overestimated its basic reproductive number. More generally,
                  our approach demonstrates that easily obtainable genetic data

                  macroecological patterns driving WNV infection, we aimed to
                  recognize unknown competent reservoirs using three disease

                  zoonotic origin have established large-scale epidemic
                  transmission cycles in the human population. It is often
                  considered that arbovirus emergence is driven by adaptive
                  evolution, such as virus adaptation for transmission by
                  'domestic' mosquito vector species that live in close

                  several emerging arboviruses, it was generally not directly
                  responsible for their initial emergence. Secondary adaptation
                  to domestic mosquitoes often amplified epidemic transmission,
                  however, this was more likely a consequence than a cause of
                  arbovirus emergence. Considering that emerging arboviruses are
                  generally 'preadapted' for transmission by domestic mosquito
                  vectors may help to enhance preparedness toward future

                  Host‐switching and geographical dispersal of parasites are
                  common phenomena, occurring on many temporal and spatial
                  scales. Diversification involving both co‐evolution and
                  colonization explains complex host–parasite associations.
                  Across the expanse of Earth history, the major radiations in
                  host–parasite assemblages have been preceded by ecological
                  disruption, ecological breakdown and host‐switching in a
                  context that can be defined by the concept of ecological
                  fitting. This cyclical process sets the stage for
                  co‐diversification during periods of relative stability,
                  punctuated by host‐switching during episodes of regional to
                  global environmental disruption and climatological change.Main
                  conclusions Most observed host–parasite associations can be
                  explained by an historical interaction between ecological
                  fitting, oscillation (episodes of increasing host range
                  alternating with isolation on particular hosts) and taxon
                  pulses (cyclical episodes of expansion and isolation in
                  geographical range). Major episodes of environmental change
                  appear to be the main drivers for both the persistence and
                  diversification of host–parasite systems, creating
                  opportunities for host‐switching during periods of
                  geographical expansion and allowing for co‐evolution and

                  zoonotic virus that repeatedly spills over to humans from its
                  rodent reservoirs. It is currently not known how climate and
                  land use changes could affect the endemic area of this virus,
                  currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring the
                  environmental data associated with virus occurrence using

                  precipitation and the presence of pastures determine
                  ecological suitability for virus circulation. Based on
                  projections of climate, land use, and population changes, we
                  find that regions in Central and East Africa will likely
                  become suitable for Lassa virus over the next decades and
                  estimate that the total population living in ecological
                  conditions that are suitable for Lassa virus circulation may
                  drastically increase by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral

                  whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution,

                  plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and
                  evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly
                  occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for
                  inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with
                  26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be
                  insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by
                  eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also
                  mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are

  abstract     = {Summary 1. Ecological specialization is one of the main
                  concepts in ecology and conservation. However, this concept
                  has become highly context‐dependent and is now obscured by the
                  great variability of existing definitions and methods used to
                  characterize ecological specialization. 2. In this study, we
                  clarify this concept by reviewing the strengths and
                  limitations of different approaches commonly used to define
                  and measure ecological specialization. We first show that
                  ecological specialization can either be considered as
                  reflecting species’ requirements or species’ impacts. We then
                  explain how specialization depends on species‐specific
                  characteristics and on local and contingent environmental
                  constraints. We further show why and how ecological
                  specialization should be scaled across spatial and temporal
                  scales, and from individuals to communities. 3. We then
                  illustrate how this review can be used as a practical toolbox
                  to classify widely used metrics of ecological specialization
                  in applied ecology, depending on the question being addressed,
                  the method used, and the data available. 4. Synthesis and
                  applications. Clarifying ecological specialization is useful
                  to make explicit connections between several fields of ecology
                  using the niche concept. Defining this concept and its
                  practical metrics is also a crucial step to better formulate
                  predictions of scientific interest in ecology and
                  conservation. Finally, understanding the different facets of
                  ecological specialization should facilitate to investigate the
                  causes and consequences of biotic homogenization and to derive
                  relevant indicators of biodiversity responses to land‐use

                  into the power of natural selection relative to gene flow and
                  other evolutionary forces. They are a paradigm for testing
                  evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular
                  environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize
                  the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We
                  first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation.
                  Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden
                  experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern
                  of deme × habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review
                  research questions and approaches to studying the processes of
                  local adaptation – divergent natural selection, dispersal and
                  gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive
                  differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted
                  approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the
                  need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about
                  the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that
                  promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of
                  replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous
                  environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus
                  would be a valuable way to complement research on natural

  abstract     = {Speciation-the origin of new species-is the source of the
                  diversity of life. A theory of speciation is essential to link
                  poorly understood macro-evolutionary processes, such as the
                  origin of biodiversity and adaptive radiation, to well
                  understood micro-evolutionary processes, such as allele
                  frequency change due to natural or sexual selection. An
                  important question is whether, and to what extent, the process
                  of speciation is 'adaptive', i.e., driven by natural and/or
                  sexual selection. Here, we discuss two main modelling
                  approaches in adaptive speciation theory. Ecological models of
                  speciation focus on the evolution of ecological
                  differentiation through divergent natural selection. These
                  models can explain the stable coexistence of the resulting
                  daughter species in the face of interspecific competition, but
                  they are often vague about the evolution of reproductive
                  isolation. Most sexual selection models of speciation focus on
                  the diversification of mating strategies through divergent
                  sexual selection. These models can explain the evolution of
                  prezygotic reproductive isolation, but they are typically
                  vague on questions like ecological coexistence. By means of an
                  integrated model, incorporating both ecological interactions
                  and sexual selection, we demonstrate that disruptive selection
                  on both ecological and mating strategies is necessary, but not
                  sufficient, for speciation to occur. To achieve speciation,
                  mating must at least partly reflect ecological
                  characteristics. The interaction of natural and sexual
                  selection is also pivotal in a model where sexual selection
                  facilitates ecological speciation even in the absence of
                  diverging female preferences. In view of these results, it is
                  counterproductive to consider ecological and sexual selection
                  models as contrasting and incompatible views on speciation,
                  one being dominant over the other. Instead, an integrative
                  perspective is needed to achieve a thorough and coherent
                  understanding of adaptive speciation.},

                  owing to the scarceness and poor molecular preservation of
                  human remains from that period3. Here we analyse 356 ancient
                  hunter-gatherer genomes, including new genomic data for 116
                  individuals from 14 countries in western and central Eurasia,
                  spanning between 35,000 and 5,000 years ago. We identify a
                  genetic ancestry profile in individuals associated with Upper
                  Palaeolithic Gravettian assemblages from western Europe that
                  is distinct from contemporaneous groups related to this
                  archaeological culture in central and southern Europe4, but
                  resembles that of preceding individuals associated with the
                  Aurignacian culture. This ancestry profile survived during the
                  Last Glacial Maximum (25,000 to 19,000 years ago) in human
                  populations from southwestern Europe associated with the
                  Solutrean culture, and with the following Magdalenian culture
                  that re-expanded northeastward after the Last Glacial Maximum.
                  Conversely, we reveal a genetic turnover in southern Europe
                  suggesting a local replacement of human groups around the time
                  of the Last Glacial Maximum, accompanied by a north-to-south
                  dispersal of populations associated with the Epigravettian
                  culture. From at least 14,000 years ago, an ancestry related
                  to this culture spread from the south across the rest of
                  Europe, largely replacing the Magdalenian-associated gene
                  pool. After a period of limited admixture that spanned the
                  beginning of the Mesolithic, we find genetic interactions
                  between western and eastern European hunter-gatherers, who
                  were also characterized by marked differences in
                  phenotypically relevant variants.},

                  Unfortunately, studies indicate that natural selection is

                  different species, informing us how they rely on one another
                  for food, pollination, and survival. If a species in an
                  ecosystem is under threat of extinction, it can affect other
                  species in the system and possibly result in their secondary
                  extinction as well. Understanding how (primary) extinctions
                  cause secondary extinctions on ecological networks has been
                  considered previously using computational methods. However,
                  these methods do not provide an explanation for the properties
                  that make ecological networks robust, and they can be
                  computationally expensive. We develop a new analytic model for
                  predicting secondary extinctions that requires no stochastic
                  simulation. Our model can predict secondary extinctions when
                  primary extinctions occur at random or due to some targeting
                  based on the number of links per species or risk of
                  extinction, and can be applied to an ecological network of any
                  number of layers. Using our model, we consider how false
                  negatives and positives in network data affect predictions for
                  network robustness. We have also extended the model to predict
                  scenarios in which secondary extinctions occur once species
                  lose a certain percentage of interaction strength, and to
                  model the loss of interactions as opposed to just species
                  extinction. From our model, it is possible to derive new
                  analytic results such as how ecological networks are most
                  robust when secondary species are of equal degree.
                  Additionally, we show that both specialization and
                  generalization in the distribution of interaction strength can
                  be advantageous for network robustness, depending upon the
                  extinction scenario being considered.},

                  responses to unusual, novel or complex socioecological
                  challenges. This buffer effect should increase survival rates

                  structure, which can potentially give rise to allopatric

                  differentiation and lineage diversification is limited. To
                  address this issue, we sampled mitochondrial DNA variation
                  within lineages of beetles and spiders across the Canary
                  Islands to explore the relationships between dispersal
                  ability, differentiation within lineages and diversification.
                  We found positive relationships between population genetic

                  Dispersal moderates patterns of gene flow and, consequently,
                  the potential for local adaptation to spatially differentiated
                  resource types. We lack both models and experiments that
                  evaluate how dispersal evolves in landscapes with multiple
                  resources. Here, we investigate the evolution of dispersal in
                  landscapes that contain two resource types that differ in
                  their spatial autocorrelations. Individuals may possess
                  ecological traits that give them a fitness advantage on one or
                  the other resource. We find that resources differing in their

                  can support the stable coexistence of distinct dispersal
                  strategies. Whether divergence in dispersal strategies between
                  resource specialists occurs depends on the underlying

                  important factor in determining when evolutionary branching is
                  likely to occur, and sheds light on when secondary isolating

                  their carriers are better suited to particular conditions, be
                  those of newly disturbed soil or a quiet river pool. Both
                  dispersal and local adaptation are major drivers of population
                  structure; however, in general, their respective roles are not
                  independent and the two may often be at odds with one another
                  evolutionarily, each one exhibiting negative feedback on the

                  discontinuities, bistability, and hysteresis in the evolved

                  evolves to avoid the competition between relatives although
                  some cost might be associated with this behaviour. The
                  evolutionarily stable dispersal distribution is characterized
                  by an equilibration of the fitness gains among all the
                  different dispersal distances. This cost‐benefit argument has
                  heuristic value and facilitates the comprehension of results
                  obtained numerically. In particular, it explains why some
                  minimal or maximal probability of dispersal may evolve at

                  partly due to the complex nature of biodiversity as a feature
                  of our planet. Subsequently, policymakers receive an
                  often-confusing variety of narratives on why biodiversity
                  matters, which makes it difficult to link biodiversity loss
                  and risks to the attainment of sustainable development. Making
                  this link clearer calls for a multidimensional perspective on
                  biodiversity to reassess what we value, facilitate
                  mainstreaming and support national decision-making. We propose
                  a co-produced Multidimensional Biodiversity Index to connect
                  biodiversity science to the political agenda that accounts for
                  the diversity of values underpinning nature–human
                  relationships. Biodiversity underpins the health and strength
                  of ecosystems, but the complexity of those systems can be
                  overwhelming for policymakers. This Perspective proposes a new
                  framework for measuring biodiversity with an eye towards

                  contributions to people’s lives. Here we present a novel
                  framework for spatial conservation prioritization based on
                  reinforcement learning that consistently outperforms available
                  state-of-the-art software using simulated and empirical data.
                  Our methodology, conservation area prioritization through
                  artificial intelligence (CAPTAIN), quantifies the trade-off
                  between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity
                  protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity
                  metrics. Under a limited budget, our model protects
                  significantly more species from extinction than areas selected
                  randomly or naively (such as based on species richness).
                  CAPTAIN achieves substantially better solutions with empirical
                  data than alternative software, meeting conservation targets
                  more reliably and generating more interpretable prioritization

                  inaccuracy characteristic of citizen science surveys, further
                  improves biodiversity outcomes. Artificial intelligence holds
                  great promise for improving the conservation and sustainable

                  developed theoretical models, both verbal and mathematical, to
                  facilitate our understanding of these patterns. Many of the
                  first quantitative models of cultural evolution were modified
                  from existing concepts in theoretical population genetics
                  because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as
                  clear differences from, genetic evolution. Furthermore,
                  cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another

                  progress has been made in the study of cultural evolution by
                  modelling it within the selectional frame. This progress has

                  (features now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose).
                  Biologists have often failed to recognize the potential
                  confusion between these different definitions because we have
                  tended to view natural selection as so dominant among
                  evolutionary mechanisms that historical process and current
                  product become one. Yet if many features of organisms are
                  non-adapted, but available for useful cooptation in
                  descendants, then an important concept has no name in our
                  lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain unconsidered):
                  features that now enhance fitness but were not built by
                  natural selection for their current role. We propose that such
                  features be called exaptations and that adaptation be
                  restricted, as Darwin suggested, to features built by
                  selection for their current role. We present several examples

                  pressures, affecting the provision of ecosystem services.
                  Therefore, it is increasingly important that we can quantify
                  and manage ecosystem services to maintain human well‐being.
                  Many ecosystem services are underpinned by ecosystem functions
                  and processes that are driven by interspecific ecological
                  interactions. Humans then benefit from ecosystem services
                  through socio‐ecological interactions. Therefore, interaction
                  network approaches can provide a unique understanding of
                  ecosystem service flows. In this paper, we assess the current
                  interface between network ecology and ecosystem services,
                  before exploring how work linking these two fields could be
                  enhanced. We emphasise the value of network approaches and
                  explore network methods to improve the assessment and
                  management of ecosystem services. Within this, we highlight
                  the role of local and indigenous knowledge in operationalising
                  network approaches in a useful ecosystem service context. Read

                  large spatial scales is an emerging research agenda in food
                  web ecology. The density of predator–prey links in a food web
                  (i.e., connectance) is a key measure of network complexity
                  that describes the mean proportional dietary breadth of
                  species within a food web. Connectance is a critical component
                  of food web robustness to species loss: food webs with lower
                  connectance have been shown to be more susceptible to
                  secondary extinctions. Identifying geographic variation in
                  food web connectance and its drivers may provide insight into
                  community robustness to species loss. We investigated the food
                  web connectance of ground-dwelling tropical forest mammal
                  communities in multiple biogeographic regions to test for
                  differences among regions in food web connectance and to test
                  three potential drivers: primary productivity, contemporary
                  anthropogenic pressure, and variation in mammal body mass
                  distributions reflective of historical extinctions. Mammal
                  communities from fifteen protected forests throughout the
                  Neo-, Afro-, and Asian tropics were identified from systematic
                  camera trap arrays. Predator–prey interaction data were
                  collected from published literature, and we calculated
                  connectance for each community as the number of observed
                  predator–prey links relative to the number of possible
                  predator–prey links. We used generalized linear models to test
                  for differences among regions and to identify the site level
                  characteristics that best predicted connectance. We found that
                  mammal food web connectance varied significantly among
                  continents and that body size range was the only significant
                  predictor. More possible predator–prey links were observed in
                  communities with smaller ranges in body size and therefore
                  sites with smaller body size ranges had higher mean
                  proportional dietary breadth. Specifically, mammal communities
                  in the Neotropics and in Madagascar had significantly higher
                  connectance than mammal communities in Africa. This geographic
                  variation in contemporary mammalian food web structure may be
                  the product of historical extinctions in the Late Quaternary,
                  which led to greater losses of large-bodied species in the
                  Neotropics and Madagascar thus contributing to higher average
                  proportional dietary breadth among the remaining smaller
                  bodied species in these regions.},

                  complex and biodiverse food webs persist in the face of
                  disturbance, and which structural properties affect
                  disturbance propagation among species. However, our
                  comprehension of assemblage mechanisms and disturbance
                  propagation in food webs is limited by the multitude of
                  stressors affecting ecosystems, impairing ecosystem
                  management. By analysing directional food web components
                  connecting species along food chains, we show that increasing
                  species richness and constant feeding linkage density promote
                  the establishment of predictable food web structures, in which
                  the proportion of species co-present in one or more food
                  chains is lower than what would be expected by chance. This
                  reduces the intrinsic vulnerability of real food webs to
                  disturbance propagation in comparison to random webs, and
                  suggests that biodiversity conservation efforts should also
                  increase the potential of ecological communities to buffer
                  top-down and bottom-up disturbance in ecosystems. The food web
                  patterns observed here have not been noticed before, and could

                  from viruses that naturally circulate in non-human
                  vertebrates. When these viruses cross over into humans, they
                  can cause disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. While
                  zoonotic host jumps have been extensively studied from an
                  ecological perspective, little attention has gone into
                  characterizing the evolutionary drivers and correlates
                  underlying these events. To address this gap, we harnessed the
                  entirety of publicly available viral genomic data, employing a
                  comprehensive suite of network and phylogenetic analyses to
                  investigate the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning recent
                  viral host jumps. Surprisingly, we find that humans are as
                  much a source as a sink for viral spillover events, insofar as
                  we infer more viral host jumps from humans to other animals
                  than from animals to humans. Moreover, we demonstrate
                  heightened evolution in viral lineages that involve putative
                  host jumps. We further observe that the extent of adaptation
                  associated with a host jump is lower for viruses with broader
                  host ranges. Finally, we show that the genomic targets of
                  natural selection associated with host jumps vary across
                  different viral families, with either structural or auxiliary
                  genes being the prime targets of selection. Collectively, our
                  results illuminate some of the evolutionary drivers underlying
                  viral host jumps that may contribute to mitigating viral

                  at targeting reservoirs of zoonotic diseases particularly in
                  countries presenting high biodiversity. Here, we developed a
                  simple method to target rodent reservoirs using published
                  studies screening microparasite infections. METHODS: We
                  compiled surveys of microparasites investigated in rodents
                  trapped in Thailand. The data comprise a total of 17,358
                  rodents from 18 species that have been investigated for a
                  total of 10 microparasites (viruses, bacteria and protozoans).
                  We used residual variation of microparasite richness
                  controlled for both rodent sample size and pathogens'
                  screening effort to identify major rodent reservoirs and
                  potential risky habitats. RESULTS: Microparasite species
                  richness was positively related to rodent sample size and
                  pathogens' screening effort. The investigation of the residual
                  variations of microparasite species richness showed that
                  several rodent species harboured more pathogens than expected
                  by the regression model. Similarly, higher pathogen richness
                  than expected was observed in rodents living in non-flooded
                  lands, forests and paddy fields. CONCLUSION: Our results
                  suggest to target some rodent species that are not commonly
                  investigated for pathogen screening or surveillance such as R.
                  adamanensis or B. savilei, and that non-flooded lands and

                  northeastern North America, bringing with them pathogens of
                  public health concern. While rodents like the white-footed
                  mouse,Peromyscus leucopus, are considered the primary
                  reservoir of many emerging tick-borne pathogens, the
                  contribution of birds, as alternative hosts and reservoirs, to
                  local transmission cycles has not yet been firmly established.
                  From 2016 to 2018, we collected host-seeking ticks and
                  examined rodent and bird hosts for ticks at 48 sites in a park
                  where blacklegged ticks are established in Quebec, Canada, in
                  order to characterize the distribution of pathogens in ticks
                  and mammalian and avian hosts. We found nearly one third of
                  captured birds (n = 849) and 70\% of small mammals (n = 694)
                  were infested withI.scapularis. Five bird and three mammal
                  species transmittedBorrelia burgdorferito feeding larvae (n
                  larvae tested = 2257) and we estimated that about one fifth of
                  theB.burgdorferi-infected questing nymphs in the park acquired
                  their infection from birds, the remaining being attributable
                  to mice. Ground-foraging bird species were more parasitized
                  than other birds, and species that inhabited open habitat were
                  more frequently infested and were more likely to
                  transmitB.burgdorferito larval ticks feeding upon them. Female
                  birds were more likely to transmit infection than males,
                  without age differentiation, whereas in mice, adult males were
                  more likely to transmit infection than juveniles and females.
                  We also detectedBorrelia miyamotoiin larvae collected from
                  birds, andAnaplasma phagocytophilumfrom a larva collected from
                  a white-footed mouse. This study highlights the importance of
                  characterising the reservoir potential of alternative
                  reservoir hosts and to quantify their contribution to
                  transmission dynamics in different species assemblages. This
                  information is key to identifying the most effective
                  host-targeted risk mitigation actions.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Cases of Lyme disease and areas with
                  self-sustaining populations of vector ticks are increasing in
                  Canada. This trend is expected to continue. Preventing Lyme
                  disease will therefore become relevant to an increasing number
                  of Canadians. OBJECTIVE: To summarize methods for reducing the
                  risk of tick bites and preventing transmission once a tick is
                  feeding. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to
                  identify methods to reduce the risk of tick bites and the
                  abundance of vector ticks, as well as the risk of becoming
                  infected with the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi
                  (BB), if bitten by a vector tick. RESULTS: Current approaches
                  to reducing the risk of tick bites or preventing infection
                  with BB once bitten are largely reliant on the individual.
                  They include use of topical repellents, use of protective
                  clothing, avoidance of risk areas and removing ticks soon
                  (ideally within a day) after they attach. These methods are
                  efficacious, but constrained by user adherence. Other
                  approaches such as landscape modification or the use of
                  acaricides to control ticks, have shown promise in other
                  countries, but have not been widely adopted in Canada.
                  CONCLUSION: Lyme disease will continue to present a threat in
                  Canada. In additional to the existing interventions for
                  prevention of tick bites and Lyme disease, there is a need for
                  new tools to help reduce the risk of Lyme disease to
                  Canadians.},

                  require fundamental transformations to humanity's
                  relationships with the rest of the planet. Achieving such
                  transformations requires that humanity improve its

                  forecasting infectious disease dynamics, but little of that
                  research is currently being applied in practice, because tools
                  do not address key public health needs, do not produce
                  probabilistic forecasts, have not been evaluated on external
                  data, or do not provide sufficient forecast skill to be
                  useful. We developed an open collaborative forecasting
                  challenge to assess probabilistic forecasts for seasonal
                  epidemics of dengue, a major global public health problem.
                  Sixteen teams used a variety of methods and data to generate
                  forecasts for 3 epidemiological targets (peak incidence, the
                  week of the peak, and total incidence) over 8 dengue seasons
                  in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Forecast skill was
                  highly variable across teams and targets. While numerous
                  forecasts showed high skill for midseason situational
                  awareness, early season skill was low, and skill was generally
                  lowest for high incidence seasons, those for which forecasts
                  would be most valuable. A comparison of modeling approaches
                  revealed that average forecast skill was lower for models
                  including biologically meaningful data and mechanisms and that
                  both multimodel and multiteam ensemble forecasts consistently
                  outperformed individual model forecasts. Leveraging these
                  insights, data, and the forecasting framework will be critical
                  to improve forecast skill and the application of forecasts in
                  real time for epidemic preparedness and response. Moreover,
                  key components of this project-integration with public health
                  needs, a common forecasting framework, shared and standardized
                  data, and open participation-can help advance infectious

                  exchange are still significant challenges for practical
                  adoption of the One Health paradigm. To address these needs
                  the "One Health Surveillance Codex" (OHS Codex) was
                  established to provide a framework for the One Health
                  community to continuously share practical solutions (e.g.
                  tools, technical resources, guidance documents and
                  experiences) applicable for national and international
                  stakeholders from different One Health Surveillance sectors.
                  Currently, the OHS Codex provides a number of resources that
                  support the adoption of the OH paradigm in areas linked to the
                  harmonization and interpretation of surveillance data. The OHS
                  Codex framework comprises four high-level "action" principles,
                  which respectively support collaboration, knowledge exchange,
                  data interoperability, and dissemination. These principles
                  match well with priority areas identified in the "Tripartite
                  Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries" published
                  by WHO, FAO and OIE. Within each of the four principles, the
                  OHS Codex provides a collection of useful resources as well as
                  pointers to success stories for the application of these
                  resources. As the OHS Codex is designed as an open community
                  framework, it will continuously evolve and adapt to the needs
                  of the OH community in the future.},

                  early investigation and outbreak preparedness. Given the
                  increasing use of genomics in virus discovery and the
                  otherwise sparse knowledge of the biology of newly discovered
                  viruses, we developed machine learning models that identify
                  candidate zoonoses solely using signatures of host range
                  encoded in viral genomes. Within a dataset of 861 viral
                  species with known zoonotic status, our approach outperformed
                  models based on the phylogenetic relatedness of viruses to
                  known human-infecting viruses (area under the receiver
                  operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.773), distinguishing
                  high-risk viruses within families that contain a minority of
                  human-infecting species and identifying putatively undetected
                  or so far unrealized zoonoses. Analyses of the underpinnings
                  of model predictions suggested the existence of generalizable
                  features of viral genomes that are independent of virus
                  taxonomic relationships and that may preadapt viruses to
                  infect humans. Our model reduced a second set of 645
                  animal-associated viruses that were excluded from training to
                  272 high and 41 very high-risk candidate zoonoses and showed
                  significantly elevated predicted zoonotic risk in viruses from
                  nonhuman primates, but not other mammalian or avian host
                  groups. A second application showed that our models could have
                  identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
                  (SARS-CoV-2) as a relatively high-risk coronavirus strain and
                  that this prediction required no prior knowledge of zoonotic
                  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-related
                  coronaviruses. Genome-based zoonotic risk assessment provides
                  a rapid, low-cost approach to enable evidence-driven virus
                  surveillance and increases the feasibility of downstream

                  features used as input to the model. Being based on solid
                  game-theoretic principles, Shapley values uniquely satisfy
                  several desirable properties, which is why they are
                  increasingly used to explain the predictions of possibly
                  complex and highly non-linear machine learning models. Shapley
                  values are well calibrated to a user's intuition when features

                  desirable properties. Moreover, causal Shapley values enable
                  us to separate the contribution of direct and indirect
                  effects. We provide a practical implementation for computing
                  causal Shapley values based on causal chain graphs when only
                  partial information is available and illustrate their utility

                  iterative protocol in which data are collected, a model is
                  trained, and then outputs of that model are used to choose
                  what data to consider next. For example, a data-driven
                  approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model
                  to predict the fitness of protein sequences and then use it to
                  propose new sequences believed to exhibit greater fitness than
                  observed in the training data. Since validating designed
                  sequences in the wet laboratory is typically costly, it is
                  important to quantify the uncertainty in the model's
                  predictions. This is challenging because of a characteristic
                  type of distribution shift between the training and test data
                  that arises in the design setting-one in which the training
                  and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is
                  chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model's error on
                  the test data-that is, the designed sequences-has an unknown
                  and possibly complex relationship with its error on the
                  training data. We introduce a method to construct confidence
                  sets for predictions in such settings, which account for the
                  dependence between the training and test data. The confidence
                  sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for
                  any regression model, even when it is used to choose the
                  test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we use
                  real datasets to demonstrate how our method quantifies
                  uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins and
                  can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve
                  acceptable tradeoffs between high predicted fitness and low
                  predictive uncertainty.},

                  prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural

                  individual predictions from a complex machine learning model
                  by learning simple, interpretable explanations. Shapley values
                  is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose.
                  The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable
                  theoretical properties, and can in principle handle any
                  predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient
                  approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like
                  several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the
                  features are independent, which may give very wrong
                  explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model
                  is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the Kernel
                  SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several
                  examples of linear and non-linear models with various degrees

                  method for aggregating individual Shapley values, such that
                  the prediction can be explained by groups of dependent

                  containing ŷ, that also contains y with probability 1  e.
                  Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for
                  producing ŷ: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector
                  machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is
                  designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted
                  successively, each one being revealed before the next is
                  predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal
                  prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled
                  independently from the same distribution, then the successive
                  predictions will be right 1  e of the time, even though they
                  are based on an accumulating data set rather than on
                  independent data sets. In addition to the model under which
                  successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line
                  compression models can also use conformal prediction. The
                  widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This
                  tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of
                  conformal prediction and works through several numerical
                  examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is

                  However, predator loss is accelerating globally4–6, and
                  predator mass-mortality events7 (MMEs)—rapid large-scale
                  die-offs—are now emblematic of the Anthropocene epoch6. Owing
                  to their rare and unpredictable nature7, we lack an
                  understanding of how MMEs immediately impact ecosystems. Past
                  predator-removal studies2,3 may be insufficient to understand
                  the ecological consequences of MMEs because, in nature, dead
                  predators decompose in situ and generate a resource pulse8,
                  which could alter ensuing ecosystem dynamics by temporarily
                  enhancing productivity. Here we experimentally induce MMEs in
                  tritrophic, freshwater lake food webs and report ecological
                  dynamics that are distinct from predator losses2,3 or resource
                  pulses9 alone, but that can be predicted from theory8. MMEs
                  led to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer
                  communities resulting from weakened top-down predator
                  control1–3 and stronger bottom-up effects through predator
                  decomposition8. In contrast to predator removals alone,
                  enhanced primary production after MMEs dampened the consumer
                  community response. As a consequence, MMEs generated biomass
                  dynamics that were most similar to those of undisturbed
                  systems, indicating that they may be cryptic disturbances in
                  nature. These biomass dynamics led to trophic decoupling,
                  whereby the indirect beneficial effects of predators on
                  primary producers are lost and later materialize as direct
                  bottom-up effects that stimulate primary production amid
                  intensified herbivory. These results reveal ecological
                  signatures of MMEs and demonstrate the feasibility of
                  forecasting novel ecological dynamics arising with
                  intensifying global change. Predator mass-mortality events
                  lead to the proliferation of diverse consumer and producer
                  communities resulting from weakened top-down predator control
                  and stronger bottom-up effects through predator decomposition.},

                  increasingly common, due to anthropogenic pressure on

                  Early and efficient vaccination can contain outbreaks and
                  prevent mass mortality, but optimal vaccine stockpiling
                  strategies are dependent on pathogen characteristics,
                  reservoir ecology, and epidemic dynamics. Here, we model major
                  regional outbreaks of Nipah virus and Middle East respiratory
                  syndrome, and use these to develop a generalized framework for
                  estimating vaccine stockpile needs based on spillover
                  geography, spatially-heterogeneous healthcare capacity and
                  spatially-distributed human mobility networks. Because
                  outbreak sizes were highly skewed, we found that most
                  outbreaks were readily contained (median stockpile estimate
                  for MERS-CoV: 2,089 doses; Nipah: 1,882 doses), but the
                  maximum estimated stockpile need in a highly unlikely large
                  outbreak scenario was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher
                  (MERS-CoV: ~87,000 doses; Nipah ~1.1 million doses).
                  Sensitivity analysis revealed that stockpile needs were more
                  dependent on basic epidemiological parameters (i.e., death and
                  recovery rate) and healthcare availability than any
                  uncertainty related to vaccine efficacy or deployment
                  strategy. Our results highlight the value of descriptive
                  epidemiology for real-world modeling applications, and suggest
                  that stockpile allocation should consider ecological,

                  (Ursus americanus) may be responsible for a significant number
                  of purported sightings of an alleged unknown species of
                  hominid in North America. Previous analyses have identified a
                  correlation between ‘sasquatch’ or ‘bigfoot’ sightings and
                  black bear populations in the Pacific Northwest using
                  ecological niche models and simple models of expected animal
                  sightings. The present study expands the analysis to the
                  entire US and Canada by modelling sasquatch sightings and bear
                  populations in each state/province while adjusting for human
                  population and forest area in a generalized linear model.
                  Sasquatch sightings were statistically significantly
                  associated with bear populations such that, on the average,
                  every bear increase in the bear population is associated with
                  a ( CI: –) increase in sasquatch sightings. Thus, as black
                  bear populations increase, sasquatch sightings are expected to
                  increase. On average, across all states and provinces in 2006,
                  after controlling for human population and forest area, there
                  were approximately bears per sasquatch sighting. Based on
                  statistical considerations, it is likely that many supposed
                  sasquatch are really misidentified known forms. If bigfoot is

                  the effects of species’ declines and extinctions have focused
                  on a single type of interaction (e.g. feeding). In nature,
                  however, diverse interactions co-occur, each of them forming a
                  layer of a ‘multilayer’ network. Data including information on
                  multiple interaction types has recently started to emerge,
                  giving us the opportunity to have a first glance at possible
                  commonalities in the structure of these networks. We studied
                  the structural features of 44 tripartite ecological networks
                  from the literature, each composed of two layers of
                  interactions (e.g. herbivory and pollination), and
                  investigated their robustness to species losses. Considering
                  two interactions simultaneously, we found that the robustness
                  of the whole community is a combination of the robustness of
                  the two ecological networks composing it. The way in which the
                  layers of interactions are connected to each other affects the
                  interdependence of their robustness. In many networks, this
                  interdependence is low, suggesting that restoration efforts
                  would not automatically propagate through the whole community.
                  Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple
                  interactions simultaneously to better gauge the robustness of
                  ecological communities to species loss and to more reliably

                  reduce the risk of future pandemics. Reducing this risk
                  requires investment in prevention, preparedness, and response.
                  Although preparedness and response have received significant
                  focus, prevention, especially the prevention of zoonotic
                  spillover, remains largely absent from global conversations.
                  This oversight is due in part to the lack of a clear
                  definition of prevention and lack of guidance on how to
                  achieve it. To address this gap, we elucidate the mechanisms
                  linking environmental change and zoonotic spillover using
                  spillover of viruses from bats as a case study. We identify
                  ecological interventions that can disrupt these spillover
                  mechanisms and propose policy frameworks for their
                  implementation. Recognizing that pandemics originate in
                  ecological systems, we advocate for integrating ecological
                  approaches alongside biomedical approaches in a comprehensive

                  between a community's structure and its long-term viability.
                  It remains unclear, however, how much a community's
                  persistence depends on the identities of the species present,
                  or how much the role played by each species varies as a
                  function of the community in which it is found. We measured
                  species' roles by studying how species are embedded within the
                  overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using
                  data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles
                  and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can
                  be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic
                  classification alone. Our results illustrate the variability
                  of roles across species and communities and the relative
                  importance of distinct species groups when attempting to

                  their overall complexity, an intriguing approach to
                  understanding network structure is by breaking it down into
                  the structural roles of its constituent species. The
                  structural role of a species can be directly measured based on
                  how it appears in network motifs – the basic building blocks
                  of complex networks. Here, we study the distribution of
                  species’ roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e.
                  species, network, and temporal) in host–parasitoid networks
                  collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented
                  landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species’
                  roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously
                  distributed across the study system but that roles are
                  strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found
                  that species’ roles were remarkably consistent between years
                  even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover).
                  Overall, our results suggest that species’ roles are an

                  SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update).
                  SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric
                  soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange
                  Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse
                  fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and
                  200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and
                  distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base
                  (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers
                  in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles
                  used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil
                  covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM
                  DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and
                  lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine
                  learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or
                  multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R
                  packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of
                  10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain
                  between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation
                  with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative
                  accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in
                  comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km
                  spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can
                  be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of
                  linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in
                  preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to
                  insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of
                  SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate
                  input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability
                  distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial
                  modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially
                  hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is
                  the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids
                  predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products
                  (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more
                  accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can
                  be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base

                  organic carbon (SOC) stock variation are necessary both for
                  our scientific understanding of the terrestrial carbon balance
                  and to support policies that intend to promote carbon storage
                  in soils to mitigate climate change. In recent years, complex
                  statistical and algorithmic tools from the field of machine
                  learning have become popular for modelling and mapping SOC
                  stocks over large areas. In this paper, we report on the
                  development of a statistical method for interpreting complex
                  models, which we implemented for the study of SOC stock
                  variation. We fitted a random forest machine learning model
                  with 2206 measurements of SOC stocks for the 0–50 cm depth
                  interval from mainland France and used a set of environmental
                  covariates as explanatory variables. We introduce Shapley
                  values, a method from coalitional game theory, and use them to
                  understand how environmental factors influence SOC stock
                  prediction: what is the functional form of the association in
                  the model between SOC stocks and environmental covariates, and
                  how does the covariate importance vary locally from one
                  location to another and between carbon-landscape zones?
                  Results were validated both in light of the existing and
                  well-described soil processes mediating soil carbon storage
                  and with regards to previous studies in the same area. We
                  found that vegetation and topography were overall the most
                  important drivers of SOC stock variation in mainland France
                  but that the set of most important covariates varied greatly
                  among locations and carbon-landscape zones. In two spatial
                  locations with equivalent SOC stocks, there was nearly an
                  opposite pattern in the individual covariate contribution that
                  yielded the prediction – in one case climate variables
                  contributed positively, whereas in the second case climate
                  variables contributed negatively – and this effect was
                  mitigated by land use. We demonstrate that Shapley values are
                  a methodological development that yield useful insights into
                  the importance of factors controlling SOC stock variation in
                  space. This may provide valuable information to understand
                  whether complex empirical models are predicting a property of
                  interest for the right reasons and to formulate hypotheses on

                  result from this modified focus? Although biodiversity
                  contributes to ecosystem services, the details of which
                  species are critical, and whether they will go functionally
                  extinct in the future, are fraught with uncertainty.
                  Explicitly considering this uncertainty, we develop an
                  analytical framework to determine how much biodiversity
                  protection would arise solely from optimising net value from
                  an ecosystem service. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we
                  find that protecting a threshold number of species is optimal,
                  and uncertainty surrounding how biodiversity produces services
                  makes it optimal to protect more species than are presumed

                  optimal protection strategy is to protect all species, no
                  species, and cases in between. We show how the optimal number
                  of species to protect depends upon different relationships
                  between species and services, including considering multiple
                  services. Our analysis provides simple criteria to evaluate
                  when managing for particular ecosystem services could warrant
                  protecting all species, given uncertainty. Evaluating this
                  criterion with empirical estimates from different ecosystems
                  suggests that optimising some services will be more likely to
                  protect most species than others.},

                  inclusive and equitable scientific community. This article,
                  while not comprehensive, serves as a starting point for
                  conversation and an introduction to current work on these
                  topics.SummaryIn response to a global dialog about systemic
                  racism, ongoing inequalities, appeals to decolonize science,
                  and the many recent calls for diversity, equity,
                  accessibility, and inclusion, we draw on the narratives of
                  plants to revisit the history of botany. Our goal is to
                  uncover how exclusionary practices have functioned in the past
                  and persist today. We also explore the numerous opportunities
                  and challenges that arise in the era of information as we
                  strive to establish a more inclusive field of botany. This
                  approach recognizes and honors the contributions of
                  historically marginalized groups, such as Black and Indigenous
                  communities. We hope that this article can serve as a catalyst
                  for raising awareness, fostering contemplation, and driving
                  action toward a more equitable and just scientific community.},

                  knowledge of the global loss of biodiversity, has been
                  experiencing rapid growth in recent decades. The increasing
                  difficulty to synthesise this literature manually has
                  simultaneously resulted in a growing demand for automated text
                  mining methods. Within the domain of deep learning, large
                  language models (LLMs) have been the subject of considerable
                  attention in recent years by virtue of great leaps in progress
                  and a wide range of potential applications, however,
                  quantitative investigation into their potential in ecology has
                  so far been lacking. In this work, we analyse the ability of
                  GPT-4 to extract information about invertebrate pests and pest
                  controllers from abstracts of a body of literature on
                  biological pest control, using a bespoke, zero-shot prompt.
                  Our results show that the performance of GPT-4 is highly
                  competitive with other state-of-the-art tools used for
                  taxonomic named entity recognition and geographic location
                  extraction tasks. On a held-out test set, we show that species
                  and geographic locations are extracted with F1-scores of
                  99.8\% and 95.3\%, respectively, and highlight that the model
                  is able to distinguish very effectively between the primary
                  roles of interest (predators, parasitoids and pests).
                  Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the model to
                  effectively extract and predict taxonomic information across
                  various taxonomic ranks, and to automatically correct spelling
                  mistakes. However, we do report a small number of cases of
                  fabricated information (hallucinations). As a result of the
                  current lack of specialised, pre-trained ecological language
                  models, general-purpose LLMs may provide a promising way
                  forward in ecology. Combined with tailored prompt engineering,
                  such models can be employed for a wide range of text mining
                  tasks in ecology, with the potential to greatly reduce time
                  spent on manual screening and labelling of the literature.},

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that

                  peer-reviewed literature assessments underpinned by expert
                  judgement. An iconic output from these assessments is the

                  with each assessment cycle, reflecting accumulating scientific
                  evidence. For future assessments, an explicit, transparent and

                  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports
                  has been a summary of how risks in a particular system could
                  change with additional warming above pre-industrial levels,
                  generally accompanied by a figure called the burning embers.
                  We present a first effort to develop burning embers for
                  climate change risks for heat-related morbidity and mortality,
                  ozone-related mortality, malaria, diseases carried by Aedes
                  sp., Lyme disease, and West Nile fever. We used an
                  evidence-based approach to construct the embers based on a
                  comprehensive global literature review. Projected risks for
                  these health outcomes under 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and >2 °C of warming
                  were used to estimate at what temperatures risk levels
                  increased from undetectable to medium, high, and very high,
                  from the pre-industrial baseline, under three adaptation
                  scenarios. Recent climate change has likely increased risks
                  from undetectable to moderate for heat-related morbidity and
                  mortality, ozone-related mortality, dengue, and Lyme disease.
                  Recent climate change also was assessed as likely beginning to
                  affect the burden of West Nile fever. A detectable impact of
                  climate change on malaria is not yet apparent but is expected
                  to occur with additional warming. The risk for each
                  climate-sensitive health outcome is projected to increase as
                  global mean surface temperature increases above pre-industrial
                  levels, with the extent and pace of adaptation expected to
                  affect the timing and magnitude of risks. The embers may be an
                  effective tool for informing efforts to build
                  climate-resilient health systems including through
                  vulnerability, capacity, and adaptation assessments and the
                  development of national adaptation plans. The embers also can
                  be used to raise awareness of future threats from climate
                  change and advocate for mitigation actions to reduce the
                  overall magnitude of health risks later this century and to
                  expand current adaptation efforts to protect populations now.},

                  the ground. Both these conceptual and practical developments
                  support the need for putting the risk of maladaptation at the
                  top of the planning agenda. The paper argues that starting
                  with the intention to avoid mistakes and not lock‐in
                  detrimental effects of adaptation‐labeled initiatives is a
                  first, key step to the wider process of adapting to climate
                  variability and change. It thus advocates for the anticipation
                  of the risk of maladaptation to become a priority for decision
                  makers and stakeholders at large, from the international to
                  the local levels. Such an ex ante approach, however, supposes
                  to get a clearer understanding of what maladaptation is.
                  Ultimately, the paper affirms that a challenge for future
                  research consists in developing context‐specific guidelines
                  that will allow funding bodies to make the best decisions to
                  support adaptation (i.e., by better capturing the risk of
                  maladaptation) and practitioners to design adaptation
                  initiatives with a low risk of maladaptation. WIREs Clim

                  the nine boundaries are transgressed, suggesting that Earth is
                  now well outside of the safe operating space for humanity.
                  Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol
                  loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone
                  levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has
                  increased for all boundaries earlier identified as
                  overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system
                  biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary
                  production is proposed as a control variable for functional
                  biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth
                  system modeling of different levels of the transgression of

  abstract     = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical
                  (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern
                  statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such
                  dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these
                  structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious
                  underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor
                  performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted
                  often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that
                  persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating
                  the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because
                  often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample
                  opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This
                  problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive
                  models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used.
                  Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically
                  rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the
                  blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in
                  space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while
                  accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly
                  induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or
                  combinations of predictor variables available for model
                  training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the
                  other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also
                  improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling
                  goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random
                  and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a
                  series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that,
                  for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly
                  universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if
                  the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for
                  selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block
                  cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist
                  in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in
                  the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account
                  for such correlations.},

                  profile beyond the scientific community due to the major
                  threats that wildlife infections pose to biological
                  conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security.
                  As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious
                  diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate
                  multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research
                  in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component,
                  cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct
                  collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building
                  upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research
                  and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to
                  help with effective integration among mathematical modelling,
                  fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at
                  all steps of a field-based research programme, from the
                  formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and
                  data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork
                  framework with two case studies we have been conducting on
                  wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie
                  dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats.
                  These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly
                  integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for
                  holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

                  infectious diseases, which can be prevented or mitigated by
                  studying host–parasite interactions, among other measures.
                  Bats and their ectoparasitic flies of the families Streblidae
                  and Nycteribiidae are an excellent study model but, so far,
                  our knowledge has been restricted to fragmented records at a
                  local scale. To help boost research, we assembled a data set
                  of bat–fly interactions from 174 studies published between
                  1904 and 2022 plus three original data sets. Altogether, these
                  studies were carried out at 650 sites in the Neotropics,
                  mainly distributed in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, southern USA,
                  and Colombia, among other countries. In total, our data set
                  contains 3984 interaction records between 237 bat species and
                  255 fly species. The bat species with the largest number of
                  recorded interactions were Carollia perspicillata (357),
                  Artibeus jamaicensis (263), and Artibeus lituratus (228). The
                  fly species with the largest number of recorded interactions
                  were Trichobius joblingi (256), Megistopoda aranea (235), and
                  Megistopoda proxima (215). The interaction data were
                  extracted, filtered, taxonomically harmonized, and made
                  available in a tidy format together with linked data on bat
                  population, fly population, study reference, sampling methods
                  and geographic information from the study sites. This
                  interconnected structure enables the expansion of information
                  for each interaction record, encompassing where and how each
                  interaction occurred, as well as the number of bats and flies
                  involved. We expect BatFly to open new avenues for research
                  focused on different levels of ecological organization and
                  spatial scales. It will help consolidate knowledge about
                  ecological specialization, resource distribution, pathogen
                  transmission, and the drivers of parasite prevalence over a
                  broad spatial range. It may also help to answer key questions
                  such as: Are there differences in fly prevalence or mean
                  infestation across Neotropical ecoregions? What ecological
                  drivers explain those differences? How do specialization
                  patterns vary among fly species in the Neotropics?
                  Furthermore, we expect BatFly to inspire research aimed at
                  understanding how climate and land‐use changes may impact
                  host–parasite interactions and disease outbreaks. This kind of
                  research may help us reach Sustainable Development Goal 3,

                  study of systems as diverse as epidemics, rumours, or indeed,
                  fires. However, since its introduction, the nature of the
                  model's scale invariance has been controversial, and the lack
                  of scaling observed in many studies diminished its theoretical
                  attractiveness. In this study, we analyse the behaviour of the
                  tree density, the average cluster size and the largest cluster
                  and show that the model could be of high practical relevance

                  From this perspective, its peculiar scaling properties should

                  that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We
                  define the species population EBVs as a
                  space-time-species-gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses
                  the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its
                  resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and
                  acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information
                  enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or
                  taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and
                  decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or
                  species data, this fundamental species population information
                  directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem
                  function indicators. The unified concept we present links
                  disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for
                  species population monitoring in which data collection is
                  closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support
                  effective biodiversity assessment.},

                  This could trigger a cascade effect on the dynamics of
                  biological communities, but the role of parasites in ecosystem
                  processes is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate
                  how parasite‐induced trait modifications shape the dynamics of
                  a complex lake food web using an allometric trophic network
                  model (ATN). We simulated infections of stage‐structured fish
                  host populations via increased maintenance costs and predation
                  risk. Our results show that host trait modifications can
                  significantly impact host demography, with stage‐specific
                  biomass declines up to 60\%. However, less severely affected
                  host stages buffered these effects and sustained the
                  population. Importantly, host biomass decline altered the
                  dynamics of species interactions and these effects cascaded
                  through the entire community, with biomass changes observed at
                  all trophic levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of
                  incorporating both indirect parasite effects and host life

                  analyzing rapid coevolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage and
                  bacteria in their ecological context. Bacteriophage enter host
                  cells via membrane-bound surface receptors often responsible
                  for nutrient uptake. As such, a selective pressure will exist
                  for the bacteria to modify its receptor configuration and, in
                  turn, for the phage to modify its tail fiber. A mathematical
                  model of these trait adaptations is developed by using the
                  framework of adaptive dynamics. Host strains differ in their
                  efficiency of resource uptake and resistance to phage, whereas
                  phage strains differ in their host preference for adsorption.
                  We solve the evolutionary ecology model and find the
                  conditions for coevolutionary branching and relevant
                  dimensionless parameters leading to distinct quasispecies. We
                  confirm these calculations using stochastic Monte Carlo
                  simulations of populations evolving in a chemostat with fixed
                  washout rate and inflow resource density. We find that
                  multiple quasispecies of bacteria and phage can coexist in a
                  homogeneous medium with a single resource. When
                  diversification occurs, quasispecies of phage adsorb
                  effectively to only a limited subset of the total number of
                  quasispecies of bacteria, i.e., functional differences between
                  quasispecies arise endogenously within the evolutionary
                  ecology framework. Finally, we discuss means to relate
                  predictions of this model to experimental studies in the
                  chemostat, using the model organisms Escherichia coli and the

                  models of predator-prey interactions, is that in predator-prey
                  cycles, peaks in prey abundance precede peaks in predator
                  abundance. Such models typically assume that species life
                  history traits are fixed over ecologically relevant time
                  scales. However, the coevolution of predator and prey traits
                  has been shown to alter the community dynamics of natural
                  systems, leading to novel dynamics including antiphase and
                  cryptic cycles. Here, using an eco-coevolutionary model, we
                  show that predator-prey coevolution can also drive population
                  cycles where the opposite of canonical Lotka-Volterra
                  oscillations occurs: predator peaks precede prey peaks. These
                  reversed cycles arise when selection favors extreme
                  phenotypes, predator offense is costly, and prey defense is
                  effective against low-offense predators. We present multiple

                  ptarmigan systems that exhibit reversed-peak ordering. Our

                  predator-prey coevolution and reveal unique ways in which
                  predator-prey coevolution can shape, and possibly reverse,

                  of specialization-local adaptation and habitat choice-under
                  different life cycles, modes of density regulation,
                  variance-covariance structures, and trade-off strengths. A
                  particular feature of our analysis is the investigation of
                  arbitrary trade-off functions. We find that local-adaptation
                  evolution qualitatively changes the outcome of habitat-choice
                  evolution under a wide range of conditions. In addition,
                  habitat-choice evolution qualitatively and invariably changes
                  the outcomes of local-adaptation evolution whenever trade-offs
                  are weak. Even weak trade-offs, which favor generalists when
                  habitat choice is fixed, select for specialists once local
                  adaptation and habitat choice are both allowed to evolve.
                  Unless trapped by maladaptive genetic constraints, joint
                  evolution of local adaptation and habitat choice in the models
                  analyzed here thus always leads to specialists, independent of
                  life cycle, density regulation, and trade-off strength, thus
                  raising the bar for evolutionarily sound explanations of
                  generalism. Whether a single specialist or two specialists
                  evolve depends on the life cycle and the mode of density
                  regulation. Finally, we explain why the gradual evolutionary
                  emergence of coexisting specialists requires more restrictive
                  conditions than does their evolutionarily stable maintenance.},

                  host-parasite webs, are reorganizing as species abundances and
                  spatial distributions shift in response to environmental
                  change. Current theoretical expectations for how this
                  reorganization will occur are available for competition or for
                  parts of interaction networks, but these may not extend to
                  more complex networks. Here we use metacommunity theory to
                  develop new expectations for how complex networks will
                  reorganize under environmental change, and show that dispersal
                  is crucial for determining the degree to which networks will
                  retain their composition and structure. When dispersal between
                  habitat patches is low, all types of species interactions act
                  as a strong determinant for whether species can colonize
                  suitable habitats. This colonization resistance drives species
                  turnover, which breaks apart current networks and leads to the
                  formation of new networks. However, when dispersal rates are
                  increased, colonists arrive in high abundance in habitats
                  where they are well adapted, so interactions with resident
                  species contribute less to colonization success. Dispersal
                  ensures that species associations are maintained as they shift
                  in space, so networks retain similar composition and
                  structure. The crucial role of dispersal reinforces the need
                  to manage habitat connectivity to sustain species and
                  interaction diversity into the future.},

                  toxic substances. E-waste is a major concern in Africa, with
                  large sites in Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is
                  dismantled under unsafe conditions. However, as in many
                  developing countries, used electronic and electrical devices
                  are imported in large quantities because they are in great
                  demand and are less expensive than new ones. Many of these
                  used products are irreparable and are discarded with other
                  solid waste to local landfills. These items are then often
                  scavenged for the purpose of extracting valuable metals by
                  heating and burning, incubating in acids and other methods.
                  These activities pose significant health risks to workers and
                  residents in communities near recycling sites. E-waste burning
                  and dismantling activities are frequently undertaken at
                  e-waste sites, often in or near homes. As a result, children
                  and people living in the surrounding areas are exposed, even
                  if they are not directly involved in the recycling. While

                  and synthesize our understanding of Anthropocene changes in
                  tropical forests. Key facets include deforestation driven by
                  agricultural expansion, timber and wood extraction, the loss
                  of fauna that maintain critical ecological connections, the
                  spread of fire, landscape fragmentation, the spread of
                  second-growth forests, new species invasion and pathogen
                  spread, increasing CO2, and climate change. The patterns of
                  change are spatially heterogeneous, are often characterized by
                  strong interactions among different drivers, can have both
                  large-scale and remote effects, and can play out through
                  ecological cascades over long timescales. As a consequence,
                  most tropical forests are on a trajectory to becoming altered
                  ecosystems, with the degree of alteration dependent on the
                  intensity and duration of the current bottleneck of

               risks by altering their behaviour or space use. Behavioural
               change in response to the presence of parasites in the
               environment generates what is known as the “landscape of disgust”
               (analogous to the predator-induced “landscape of fear”). Using a
               spatial description of cues that indicate parasite risk, and
               characterizing individual responses to those cues, can allow
               researchers to quantify and interpret how hosts navigate the
               landscape of disgust. The landscape of disgust framework could
               facilitate much needed research on the ecological impacts of
               parasitism, advancing the fields of disease, spatial, and
               behavioural ecology. 2. Despite the potential for improving our
               inference of host-parasite dynamics, three key limitations of the
               landscape of disgust restrict the potential insight that can be
               gained from current research. First, many host-parasite systems
               will not be appropriate for invoking the landscape of disgust
               framework. Second, existing research has primarily focused on
               immediate choices made by hosts on small scales, limiting
               predictive power, generalizability, and the value of the insight
               obtained from the landscape of disgust framework. Finally,
               relevant ecological and evolutionary theory has not been
               integrated into the framework, challenging our ability to
               interpret and understand the application of the landscape of
               disgust within the context of most host-parasite systems. 3. In
               this review, we explore the specific requirements for
               implementing a landscape of disgust framework in empirical

                  explored in statistical phylogenetics, emphasizing the need
                  for new approaches to statistical model representation and
                  software development. Clear communication and representation
                  of the chosen model is crucial for: (i) reproducibility of an
                  analysis, (ii) model development, and (iii) software design.
                  Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for
                  model representation lowers the barrier for beginners and
                  nonspecialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including
                  their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies.
                  Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in
                  popularity in the statistical literature in recent years. The
                  core idea is to break complex models into conditionally
                  independent distributions. The strength lies in the
                  comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this
                  formalism, and the large body of computational work based on
                  it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical
                  models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists and
                  in the development of generic software for simulation and
                  statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to
                  graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard
                  graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics.
                  We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to
                  capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding
                  to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic
                  models using the graphical model framework and introduce
                  modules to simplify the representation of standard components
                  in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be
                  readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and
                  Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings or

                  within species to differences between populations,
                  communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult
                  to realize in great part because of the complexity of
                  biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of
                  theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other
                  theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic
                  diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial
                  stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to
                  consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to
                  ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require
                  theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to
                  reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have
                  solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic
                  to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution
                  are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty.
                  Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and
                  probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich
                  knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent
                  complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability
                  to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and

                  associated with larval habitat changes. As an initial effort,
                  in this study, we characterized the microenvironments of Ae.
                  aegypti larval sites in forest and domestic habitats in two
                  African localities: La Lopé, Gabon, and Rabai, Kenya.
                  Specifically, we measured the physical characteristics,
                  microbial density, bacterial composition, and volatile
                  chemical profiles of multiple larval sites. In both
                  localities, comparisons between natural containers in the
                  forests and artificial containers in the villages revealed
                  significantly different microenvironments. We next examined
                  whether the between-habitat differences in larval site
                  microenvironments lead to differences in oviposition, a key
                  behavior affecting larval distribution. Forest Ae. aegypti
                  readily accepted the artificial containers we placed in the
                  forests. Laboratory choice experiments also did not find
                  distinct oviposition preferences between forest and village
                  Ae. aegypti colonies. These results suggested that African Ae.
                  aegypti are likely generalists in their larval site choices.
                  This flexibility to accept various containers with a wide
                  range of physical, microbial, and chemical conditions might
                  allow Ae. aegypti to use human-stored water as fallback larval
                  sites during dry seasons, which is hypothesized to have
                  initiated the domestic evolution of Ae. aegypti.},

                heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.
                Understanding uncertainty is critical for many analytical tasks.
                One common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty
                values independently, using two visual variables. These
                resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and
                interference between visual channels can reduce the
                discriminability of marks. To address this issue, we contribute
                Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs). VSUPs allocate
                larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is
                low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. This
                non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more
                economical use of the limited visual encoding space when
                uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making
                when uncertainty is high. We demonstrate several examples of
                VSUPs, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that,
                compared to traditional bivariate maps, VSUPs encourage people

                  degrees of open sharing, posing challenges for research on
                  macroecology, evolution, and public health. Here, we solve
                  this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database
                  of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in
                  One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled
                  through both reconciliation of static data sets and
                  integration of dynamically updated databases. These data
                  sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone,
                  including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and
                  higher classification; additional metadata on sampling
                  methodology and evidence strength are also available in a
                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an
                  unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global
                  virome.},

              under such decision making systems (e.g. denied credit)
              irrespective of whether the decision is fair or accurate.
              Individual recourse pertains to the problem of providing an
              actionable set of changes a person can undertake in order to
              improve their outcome. We propose a recourse algorithm that models
              the underlying data distribution or manifold. We then provide a
              mechanism to generate the smallest set of changes that will
              improve an individual's outcome. This mechanism can be easily used
              to provide recourse for any differentiable machine learning based
              decision making system. Further, the resulting algorithm is shown
              to be applicable to both supervised classification and causal

                  valuing and incorporating contributions from all knowledge
                  systems in scientific pursuits. This approach emphasizes the
                  ongoing bias, including within scientific practices, and the
                  necessity of discussing problematic histories within spaces of
                  learning. It is crucial to acknowledge and address biases,
                  even within scientific endeavors. Doing so fosters a more
                  inclusive and equitable scientific community. This article,
                  while not comprehensive, serves as a starting point for
                  conversation and an introduction to current work on these

                  and the many recent calls for diversity, equity,
                  accessibility, and inclusion, we draw on the narratives of
                  plants to revisit the history of botany. Our goal is to
                  uncover how exclusionary practices have functioned in the past
                  and persist today. We also explore the numerous opportunities
                  and challenges that arise in the era of information as we

                  analysis the method of synthesis has received little
                  attention. Ecologists usually proceed intuitively and this can
                  lead to a problem in defining differences between the
                  syntheses made by different scientists. It also leads to
                  criticism from scientists favoring analytical approaches that
                  the construction of general theory is an activity that does
                  not follow the scientific method. We outline a methodology for
                  scientific inference about integrative concepts and the
                  syntheses made in constructing them and illustrate how this
                  can be applied in the development of general theory from
                  investigations into particular ecological systems. The
                  objective is to construct a causal scientific explanation.
                  This has four characteristics. (1) It defines causal and/or
                  organizational processes that describe how systems function.
                  (2) These processes are consistent – under the same conditions
                  they will produce the same effect. (3) A causal scientific
                  explanation provides general information about events of a
                  similar kind. (4) When experiments are possible then a
                  designed manipulation will produce a predictable response. The
                  essential characteristic of making synthesis to construct a
                  causal scientific explanation is that it is progressive and we
                  judge progress made by assessing the coherence of the
                  explanation using six criteria: acceptability of individual
                  propositions including that they have been tested with data,
                  consistency of concept definitions, consistency in the type of
                  concepts used in making the explanation, that ad hoc
                  propositions are not used, that there is economy in the number
                  of propositions used, that the explanation applies to broad
                  questions. We illustrate development of a causal scientific
                  explanation for the concept of long-lived pioneer tree
                  species, show how the coherence of this explanation can be
                  assessed, and how it could be improved.},

                  Although the field has progressed rapidly regarding theory and

                  biodiversity in the 1980s, along with the concept of the

                  the global biodiversity information facility (GBIF) we

                  construction dedicated to monitoring a new object: the global
                  diversity. We argue that, biodiversity big data became a
                  powerful driver behind the invention of the concept of the
                  global environment, and a way to embed ecological science in

                  explicitly statistical perspective, using stochastic models to
                  describe the evolution of species range as a continuous-time
                  Markov process of dispersal between and extinction within a
                  set of discrete geographic areas. The main constraint of these
                  methods is the computational limit on the number of areas that
                  can be specified. We propose a Bayesian approach for inferring
                  biogeographic history that extends the application of
                  biogeographic models to the analysis of more realistic
                  problems that involve a large number of areas. Our solution is
                  based on a "data-augmentation" approach, in which we first
                  populate the tree with a history of biogeographic events that
                  is consistent with the observed species ranges at the tips of
                  the tree. We then calculate the likelihood of a given history
                  by adopting a mechanistic interpretation of the
                  instantaneous-rate matrix, which specifies both the
                  exponential waiting times between biogeographic events and the
                  relative probabilities of each biogeographic change. We
                  develop this approach in a Bayesian framework, marginalizing
                  over all possible biogeographic histories using Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides dramatically increasing the number
                  of areas that can be accommodated in a biogeographic analysis,
                  our method allows the parameters of a given biogeographic
                  model to be estimated and different biogeographic models to be
                  objectively compared. Our approach is implemented in the

                  crucial for socioeconomic risk assessments, yet model
                  discrepancies limit their application. Here we use a
                  pattern-filtering technique to identify low-frequency changes
                  in individual members of a multi-model ensemble, to assess
                  discrepancies across models in the projected pattern and
                  magnitude of change. Specifically, we apply low-frequency
                  component analysis (LFCA) to the intensity and frequency of
                  daily precipitation extremes over land in 21 CMIP-6 models.
                  LFCA brings modest but statistically significant improvements
                  in the agreement between models in the spatial pattern of
                  projected change, particularly in scenarios with weak
                  greenhouse forcing. Moreover, we show that LFCA facilitates a
                  robust identification of the rates at which increasing
                  precipitation extremes scale with global temperature change
                  within individual ensemble members. While these rates
                  approximately match expectations from the Clausius-Clapeyron
                  relation on average across models, individual models exhibit
                  considerable and significant differences. Monte-Carlo
                  simulations indicate that these differences contribute to
                  uncertainty in the magnitude of projected change at least as
                  much as differences in the climate sensitivity. Finally, we
                  compare these scaling rates to those identified from
                  observational products, demonstrating that virtually all
                  climate models significantly underestimate the rates at which
                  increases in precipitation extremes have scaled with global
                  temperatures historically. Constraining projections with
                  observations therefore amplifies the projected intensification
                  of precipitation extremes as well as reducing the relative
                  error of their distribution.},

                  (frequency-dependence) and a linear (density-dependence)
                  contact-density function, but it is becoming increasingly
                  clear that intermediate, nonlinear functions are more
                  realistic. It is currently not clear, however, what the exact
                  consequences would be of different contact-density functions
                  in fluctuating populations. By combining field data on rodent

                  The shape of the transmission-density function should
                  therefore be chosen with care, and is ideally based on

                  transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted and vector-borne
                  diseases are likely to be frequency- rather than
                  density-dependent, which results in qualitatively different
                  dynamics. Here, we present analyses of a basic epidemiological
                  model in which the transmission process is represented as a
                  function of the population disease frequency. In an extension
                  of the basic model, we consider disease transmission as a
                  probability function that assumes that the chance of becoming
                  infected increases with the number of vector contacts.
                  Stability analyses show that host-pathogen coexistence is
                  possible in vector-transmitted and sexually transmitted
                  disease systems in which transmission is likely to be
                  frequency-dependent; the potential for stable coexistence is
                  greatest for intermediate rates of disease spread and weak
                  density dependence of host growth rate. Extension of the basic
                  frequency-dependent model to allow for multiple contacts among
                  hosts indicates that parameter ranges within which coexistence
                  is predicted are thereby broadened.},

                  primarily present where they co‐occur with range‐expanding

                  morphs are commonly found within the equatorward portion of
                  the species' range (where abundances are highest), in
                  populations overlapping with range‐expanding warm‐water
                  predators. Bent morphs primarily occur within the smaller size
                  classes.Main conclusionsTo be partly resilient to the effects
                  of tropicalisation, temperate prey must acclimatise/adapt to
                  altered predator–prey dynamics. Predator‐induced defences are
                  one way to do this. We show that bent morphs within a
                  temperate prey species (T. rubescens) are largely restricted
                  to populations that overlap with large‐bodied and
                  range‐expanding warm‐water predators. This is evidence for the
                  partial resilience of T. rubescens to tropicalisation and
                  provides the rationale for further exploration of the

                  a result, we argue that projections of climate and its effects
                  on human well-being and associated governance and policy must
                  be framed beyond 2100.},

                  collaboration. However, there is a lack of published evidence
                  of the awareness of the OH concept in Colombia and other
                  countries in the Latin American Region. In order to explore
                  existing collaboration amongst the animal health, human-public
                  health, environmental health sectors, and to describe the
                  perception, knowledge, and barriers on OH in Colombia and
                  other countries of Latin America, an online
                  questionnaire-based survey was distributed among key
                  professionals representing the three OH pillars (August
                  2018-August 2020). Overall, 76 key respondents from 13
                  countries (Colombia, México, Chile, Brazil, Argentina,
                  Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Perú, Guatemala, Nicaragua
                  Uruguay, and Venezuela) completed the questionnaire.
                  Respondents worked in institutions of animal (59\%), public
                  (20\%), human (7\%), and environmental health (7\%); they
                  mainly belonged to higher academic institutions (59\%),
                  followed by ministries (11\%), and research organizations
                  (9\%). Most participants (92\%) were familiar with the OH term
                  and 68\% were aware of the formal cooperation among sectors in
                  their countries, mostly on zoonoses; in 46\% of the cases,
                  such connections were established in the last 5 years. The
                  main reported limiting factors to intersectorality were the
                  lack of commitment of policy-makers, resources, and budget for
                  OH (38\%) and the "siloed approach" of sectors and disciplines
                  (34\%). Respondents ranked a median score of 3.0 (1-5 scoring)
                  in how good OH activities are implemented in their countries,
                  and a median score of 2.0 in the citizen awareness on OH as
                  regards their countries. The most important OH issues were
                  identified in vector-borne diseases, rabies, wrong and/or
                  improper use of antimicrobials, emerging viral diseases,
                  food-borne diseases, neglected parasitic diseases,
                  deforestation, and ecosystem fragmentation. Although there is
                  a high-perceived importance on conjoint cooperation, OH
                  implementation, and operationalization remain weak, and the
                  environmental component is not well-integrated. We consider

                  support countries to improve their health policies and health
                  governance as well as to advocate the social, economic, and

                  it is crucial to find methods to better describe, manage, and
                  sustain aquatic ecosystems. Ecosystem modelling has become an
                  important tool in integrating trophic relationships into food
                  webs, assessing important nodes using network analysis, and
                  making predictions via simulations. Fortunately, several
                  modelling techniques exist, but the question is which approach
                  is relevant and applicable when? In this study, we compare
                  three modelling frameworks (Ecopath, Loop Analysis in R,
                  STELLA software) using a case study of a small aquatic network
                  (8 nodes). The choice of framework depends on the research
                  question and data availability. We approach this topic from a
                  methodological aspect by describing the data requirements and
                  by comparing the applicability and limitations of each
                  modelling approach. Each modelling framework has its specific
                  focus, but some functionalities and outcomes can be compared.
                  The predictions of Loop Analysis as compared to Ecopath’s
                  Mixed Trophic Impact plot are in good agreement at the top and
                  bottom trophic levels, but the middle trophic levels are less
                  similar. This suggests that further comparisons are needed of
                  networks of varying resolution and size. Generally, when data
                  are limiting, Loop Analysis can provide qualitative
                  predictions, while the other two methods provide quantitative
                  results, yet rely on more data.},

                  of various organisms can complement this trophic view. The
                  combination of traits and food web positions are studied here
                  on a large food web database. The aim is a better description

                  identification of the most important keystone species. This
                  may contribute to develop better ecological indicators (e.g.,
                  keystoneness) and help in the interpretation of food web
                  models. We use food web data from the Ecopath with Ecosim
                  (EwE) database for 92 aquatic ecosystems. We quantify the
                  network position of organisms by 18 topological indices
                  (measuring centrality, hierarchy, and redundancy) and consider
                  their three, categorical traits (e.g., for mobility: sessile,
                  drifter, limited mobility, and mobile). Relationships are
                  revealed by multivariate analysis. We found that topological
                  indices belong to six different categories and some of them
                  nicely separate various trait categories. For example, benthic
                  organisms are richly connected and mobile organisms occupy
                  higher food web positions.}

                  positively correlated, independent of geographic distance. IBE
                  represents one of the most important patterns that results
                  from the ways in which landscape heterogeneity influences gene
                  flow and population connectivity, but it has only recently
                  been examined in studies of ecological and landscape genetics.
                  Nevertheless, the study of IBE presents valuable opportunities
                  to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in ecological
                  processes, agents of selection and environmental variables
                  contributes to genetic divergence in nature. New and
                  increasingly sophisticated studies of IBE in natural systems

                  understanding of the role of ecology in genetic divergence and

                  extent of accessible areas (M) as a delimitation of the CA,
                  which theoretically includes the species' dispersal ability
                  and its barriers. We recommend using the BE method, which is

                  (SARS-CoV2). Bats have been recognized as an important
                  reservoir of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs). In West Africa,
                  where there is a high diversity of bat species, little is

                  Guinea, we tested a total of 319 bats belonging to 14 genera
                  and six families of insectivorous and frugivorous bats across
                  the country, for the presence of coronaviruses. We found CoVs
                  in 35 (11\%) of the tested bats-in three insectivorous bat
                  species and five fruit bat species that were mostly captured
                  close to human habitat. Positivity rates varied from 5.7\% to
                  100\%, depending on bat species. A wide diversity of alpha and
                  beta coronaviruses was found across the country, including
                  three sequences belonging to SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs subgenera
                  known to harbor highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Our

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal
                  Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial Cytochrome Oxidase
                  I). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that
                  molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated,
                  and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units

                  Lamellodiscus morphology is probably constrained by strong
                  environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  specialization is central to our understanding of community
                  ecology and evolution. Although theoretical work has
                  investigated how variable environments may affect
                  specialization in single species, little is known about how
                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in
                  antagonistically coevolving systems. Here, we develop and
                  analyse a general model of victim-enemy coevolution that
                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy
                  investment in infectivity. We also investigate the
                  epidemiological consequences of environmental variability and
                  show that enemy population density is maximized for
                  intermediate lengths of productive seasons, which corresponds
                  to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than
                  victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the
                  light of empirical studies, and further highlight ways in
                  which our model applies to a range of natural systems.},

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the biological sciences. While there are reliable ways to
                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for
                  species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend
                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are
                  available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb
                  structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under
                  different global change scenarios.},

                  scales, ecological specialisation, i.e. organisms

                  thought to be a driver promoting niche diversity. It is not

                  specialist-generalist coexistence.MethodsWe reconstruct the
                  structure of five bacteria-phage networks from soil isolates,
                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite
                  performance.ResultsWe show that the co-occurrence of species
                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful

                  importantly, as each optimization method uses a different
                  optimization criterion, there is a need to have an a
                  posteriori measure serving as an equivalent of a
                  goodness-of-fit. In this article, I propose such a measure of
                  modularity, which is simply defined as the ratio of
                  interactions established between members of the same modules
                  vs. members of different modules. I apply this measure to a
                  large dataset of 290 ecological networks representing
                  host-parasite (bipartite) and predator-prey (unipartite)
                  interactions, to show how the results are easy to interpret
                  and present especially to a broad audience not familiar with
                  modularity analyses, but still can reveal new features about
                  modularity and the ways to measure it.},

                  mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as
                  undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of

                  understanding of mathematical models; 75\% felt that the level
                  of mathematics was "too low" in their ecology classes; 90\%

                  disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the
                  invaded patch exceeding a threshold, highlighting the likely
                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional
                  coexistence is in fact possible in an explicitly spatial

                  population can exclude the enemy. More broadly, the
                  establishment of protective mutualists may be favored when
                  there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic

               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

                  often involve some degree of projection into novel covariate
                  space (i.e. extrapolation), because calibration data may not
                  encompass the entire space of interest. Most methods for
                  identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each model
                  covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that
                  is well within the range of univariate variation, but which
                  exhibits novel combinations between covariates. Our objective
                  was to develop a tool that can detect, distinguish and
                  quantify these two types of novelties: novel univariate range
                  and novel combinations of covariates.LocationGlobal,
                  Australia, South Africa.MethodsWe developed a new multivariate
                  statistical tool, based on the Mahalanobis distance, which
                  measures the similarity between the reference and projection
                  domains by accounting for both the deviation from the mean and
                  the correlation between variables. The method also provides an
                  assessment tool for the detection of the most influential
                  covariates leading to dissimilarity. As an example
                  application, we modelled an Australian shrub (Acacia cyclops)
                  widely introduced to other countries and compared reference
                  data, global distribution data and both types of model
                  extrapolation against the projection globally and in South
                  Africa.ResultsThe new tool successfully detected and
                  quantified the degree of dissimilarity for points that were
                  either outside the univariate range or formed novel covariate
                  combinations (correlations) but were still within the
                  univariate range of covariates. For A. cyclops, more than half
                  of the points (6617 of 10,785) from the global projection
                  space that were found to lie within the univariate range of
                  reference data exhibited distorted correlations. Not all the
                  climate covariates used for modelling contributed to novelty

                  projection.Main conclusionsIdentifying non‐analogous

                  change1. Signals of biodiversity change come from time-series
                  abundance datasets for thousands of species over large
                  geographic and temporal scales. Analyses of these biodiversity
                  datasets have pointed to varied trends in abundance, including
                  increases and decreases. However, these analyses have not
                  fully accounted for spatial, temporal and phylogenetic
                  structures in the data. Here, using a new statistical
                  framework, we show across ten high-profile biodiversity
                  datasets2–11 that increases and decreases under existing
                  approaches vanish once spatial, temporal and phylogenetic
                  structures are accounted for. This is a consequence of
                  existing approaches severely underestimating trend uncertainty
                  and sometimes misestimating the trend direction. Under our
                  revised average abundance trends that appropriately recognize
                  uncertainty, we failed to observe a single increasing or
                  decreasing trend at 95\% credible intervals in our ten
                  datasets. This emphasizes how little is known about
                  biodiversity change across vast spatial and taxonomic scales.
                  Despite this uncertainty at vast scales, we reveal improved
                  local-scale prediction accuracy by accounting for spatial,
                  temporal and phylogenetic structures. Improved prediction
                  offers hope of estimating biodiversity change at
                  policy-relevant scales, guiding adaptive conservation
                  responses. This study presents an approach to deal with
                  spatial, temporal and phylogenetic non-independence in
                  large-scale analyses of biodiversity change, improving trend
                  estimation and inference across scales.},

                  require fundamental transformations to humanity's
                  relationships with the rest of the planet. Achieving such
                  transformations requires that humanity improve its

                  ecology is to predict which combinations of species and
                  habitats most effectively promote and prevent biological
                  invasions. Here, we integrate models of network structure and
                  nonlinear population dynamics to search for potential
                  generalities among trophic factors that may drive invasion
                  success and failure. We simulate invasions where 100 different
                  species attempt to invade 150 different food webs with 15-26
                  species and a wide range (0.06-0.32) of connectance. These
                  simulations yield 11 438 invasion attempts by non-basal
                  species, 47 per cent of which are successful. At the time of
                  introduction, whether or not the invader is a generalist best
                  predicts final invasion success; however, once the invader
                  establishes itself, it is best distinguished from unsuccessful
                  invaders by occupying a lower trophic position and being
                  relatively invulnerable to predation. In general, variables
                  that reflect the interaction between an invading species and
                  its new community, such as generality and trophic position,
                  best predict invasion success; however, for some trophic
                  categories of invaders, fundamental species traits, such as
                  having the centre of the feeding range low on the theoretical
                  niche axis (for non-omnivorous and omnivorous herbivores), or
                  the topology of the food web (for tertiary carnivores), best
                  predict invasion success. Across all invasion scenarios, a
                  discriminant analysis model predicted successful and failed
                  invasions with 76.5 per cent accuracy for properties at the
                  time of introduction or 100 per cent accuracy for properties
                  at the time of establishment. More generally, our results
                  suggest that tackling the challenge of predicting the
                  properties of species and habitats that promote or inhibit
                  invasions from food web perspective may aid ecologists in
                  identifying rules that govern invasions in natural ecosystems.},

                  the common formatting and archiving of ecological forecasts
                  and the metadata associated with these forecasts. Such open
                  standards are intended to promote interoperability and
                  facilitate forecast communication, distribution, validation,
                  and synthesis. For output files, we first describe the
                  convention conceptually in terms of global attributes,
                  forecast dimensions, forecasted variables, and ancillary
                  indicator variables. We then illustrate the application of
                  this convention to the two file formats that are currently
                  preferred by the EFI, netCDF (network common data form), and
                  comma‐separated values (CSV), but note that the convention is
                  extensible to future formats. For metadata, EFI's convention
                  identifies a subset of conventional metadata variables that
                  are required (e.g., temporal resolution and output variables)
                  but focuses on developing a framework for storing information
                  about forecast uncertainty propagation, data assimilation, and
                  model complexity, which aims to facilitate cross‐forecast
                  synthesis. The initial application of this convention expands
                  upon the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), a commonly used
                  metadata standard in ecology. To facilitate community
                  adoption, we also provide a Github repository containing a
                  metadata validator tool and several vignettes in R and Python
                  on how to both write and read in the EFI standard. Lastly, we
                  provide guidance on forecast archiving, making an important
                  distinction between short‐term dissemination and long‐term
                  forecast archiving, while also touching on the archiving of
                  code and workflows. Overall, the EFI convention is a living
                  document that can continue to evolve over time through an open
                  community process.},

                  Historically, scientists have used reductionist methodologies
                  that rely on a priori sex categorizations, in which two
                  discrete sexes are inextricably linked with gamete type.
                  However, this binarized operationalization does not adequately
                  reflect the diversity of sex observed in nature. This is due,
                  in part, to the fact that sex exists across many levels of
                  biological analysis, including genetic, molecular, cellular,
                  morphological, behavioral, and population levels. Furthermore,
                  the biological mechanisms governing sex are embedded in
                  complex networks that dynamically interact with other systems.
                  To produce the most accurate and scientifically rigorous work
                  examining sex in neuroendocrinology and to capture the full
                  range of sex variability and diversity present in animal
                  systems, we must critically assess the frameworks,
                  experimental designs, and analytical methods used in our
                  research. In this perspective piece, we first propose a new
                  conceptual framework to guide the integrative study of sex.
                  Then, we provide practical guidance on research approaches for
                  studying sex-associated variables, including factors to
                  consider in study design, selection of model organisms,
                  experimental methodologies, and statistical analyses. We
                  invite fellow scientists to conscientiously apply these
                  modernized approaches to advance our biological understanding
                  of sex and to encourage academically and socially responsible
                  outcomes of our work. By expanding our conceptual frameworks
                  and methodological approaches to the study of sex, we will
                  gain insight into the unique ways that sex exists across
                  levels of biological organization to produce the vast array of
                  variability and diversity observed in nature.},

                  end, we compiled the most comprehensive data set on the
                  distribution of this species during the Last Interglacial
                  optimum (MIS 5e) available to date. This was used to calibrate

                  E).MethodsWe used archaeological records and palaeoclimatic
                  and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an
                  ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different
                  combinations of predictors and weighted background data. Area
                  under the curve scores computed by leave‐one‐out were used to
                  assess variable importance at the continental scale, while
                  local regression combined with recursive partition trees was
                  used to assess variable importance at the local
                  scale.ResultsAnnual rainfall and winter temperatures were the
                  most important predictors at the continental scale, while
                  topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at
                  the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were
                  observed along the Mediterranean coastlines. Mountain ranges
                  and continental plains showed low habitat suitability
                  values.Main conclusionsThe model results confirmed that
                  abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping
                  Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial. The
                  high suitability of the Mediterranean coastlines and the low
                  suitability values of most sites at the northern and eastern
                  distribution limits (Germany, Hungary, Ukraine) challenge the
