                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service

                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  species pool) are a powerful abstraction to understand how
                  large‐scale species interaction networks are structured.
                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and
                  taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly
                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the
                  limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first
                  approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to
                  predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using
                  graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species

                  networks created by different sets of researchers to test
                  their hypotheses regarding how ecological processes drive
                  network topology. Yet, topological properties identified
                  across these networks may not be sufficiently attributable to
                  ecological processes alone as often assumed. Instead, much of
                  the totality of topological differences between
                  networks-topological heterogeneity-could be due to variations
                  in research designs and approaches that different researchers
                  use to create each species interaction network. To evaluate
                  the degree to which this topological heterogeneity is present
                  in available ecological networks, we first compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity across 723 species interaction
                  networks created by different sets of researchers with the
                  amount quantified from non-ecological networks known to be
                  constructed following more consistent approaches. Then, to
                  further test whether the topological heterogeneity was due to
                  differences in study designs, and not only to inherent
                  variation within ecological networks, we compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity between species interaction
                  networks created by the same sets of researchers (i.e.,
                  networks from the same publication) with the amount quantified
                  between networks that were each from a unique publication
                  source. We found that species interaction networks are highly
                  topologically heterogeneous: while species interaction
                  networks from the same publication are much more topologically
                  similar to each other than interaction networks that are from
                  a unique publication, they still show at least twice as much
                  heterogeneity as any category of non-ecological networks that
                  we tested. Altogether, our findings suggest that extra care is
                  necessary to effectively analyze species interaction networks
                  created by different researchers, perhaps by controlling for
                  the publication source of each network.},

                  expansion, can negatively influence a lake's capacity to

                  lakes most at risk of losing their ES (i.e., higher
                  vulnerability) requires integrating information on lake
                  ecological state, global change threats, and ES use. Here, we
                  provide a social–ecological framework that combines these
                  features within a regional context by evaluating the
                  ecological state of 659 lakes across Canada. Using the
                  deviation of impacted lakes from reference ones, we identified
                  much higher total nitrogen and chloride concentrations as the
                  main indicators of an altered lake ecological state in all
                  regions identified. Lake ecological state was mapped using an
                  additive colour model along with regional scores of threat
                  levels and recreational ES use. Urban and agriculturally
                  developed areas were linked to higher lake vulnerability and
                  ES loss. Lakes in Southern Ontario were most concerning, being
                  highly altered, under threat, and heavily used. Lakes near
                  coastal urban centers were altered and used, but less
                  threatened, whereas those in the Prairies were altered and
                  threatened, but less used. Our novel framework provides the

  abstract     = {Food webs are complex ecological networks whose structure is
                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},
