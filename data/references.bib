  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this
                  result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within
                  nuclear 18S and mitochondrial COI genes are compared for
                  several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the
                  level of diversification within a genus. Overall our results
                  suggest that cryptic speciation events may occur within
                  Lamellodiscus, and discuss the links between morphological and

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite

                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful

                  global biogeochemical cycles, incidence of human diseases,
                  productivity of industrial microbial commodities, and patterns
                  of microbial genome diversity. Unfortunately, given the
                  extreme diversity and complexity of microbial communities,
                  traditional analyses fail to characterize interaction patterns
                  and underlying processes. Here, we review emerging systems
                  approaches that combine empirical data with rigorous
                  theoretical analysis to study phage-bacterial interactions as
                  networks rather than as coupled interactions in isolation.},

                  tool in community ecology. Because organisms with the same
                  lifestyle can still exhibit ecological differences, it is
                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be
                  described. Here we show that networks of hosts (mammals) and
                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to
                  include in ecological networks, which we discuss in the light
                  of community ecology and epidemiology.},

                  random expectations, important to understand their structure
                  and emerging properties. Several measures exist to assess
                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of
                  how modular the network is) and different module compositions
                  (i.e. different groups of species forming said modules). More
                  importantly, as each optimization method uses a different
                  optimization criterion, there is a need to have an a
                  posteriori measure serving as an equivalent of a
                  goodness-of-fit. In this article, I propose such a measure of
                  modularity, which is simply defined as the ratio of
                  interactions established between members of the same modules
                  vs. members of different modules. I apply this measure to a
                  large dataset of 290 ecological networks representing
                  host-parasite (bipartite) and predator-prey (unipartite)
                  interactions, to show how the results are easy to interpret
                  and present especially to a broad audience not familiar with
                  modularity analyses, but still can reveal new features about
                  modularity and the ways to measure it.},

                  so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were
                  mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as
                  undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of
                  quantitative training: 75\% were not satisfied with their
                  understanding of mathematical models; 75\% felt that the level
                  of mathematics was "too low" in their ecology classes; 90\%
                  wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95\% more
                  statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30\% of classes
                  in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative
                  disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing
                  programs. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training
                  was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied
                  ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will
                  require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related
                  degrees that contain good mathematical and statistical
                  practice.},

                  a better understanding of the worldwide distribution of
                  diseases through space and time. We analyze 100 years of
                  records of diseases occurrence worldwide. We use a

                  structure of human infectious diseases, and its dynamics over
                  the Twentieth Century. Since the 1960s, there is a clear
                  homogenizing of human pathogens worldwide, with most diseases
                  expanding their geographical area. The occurrence network of
                  human pathogens becomes markedly more connected, and less
                  modular. Human infectious diseases are steadily expanding
                  their ranges since the 1960s, and disease occurrence has
                  become more homogenized at a global scale. Our findings

                  designing policies for the prevention of outbreaks.}
