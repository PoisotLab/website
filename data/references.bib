  abstract     = {Summary There is a growing realization among community
                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  Investment in gonads and activity of mucus lysozyme were
                  negatively correlated; lysozyme activity decreased as

                  cephalus. There was a positive correlation, however, between

                  investment in gonads and spleen were correlated, showing that

                  described species, regrouped in four morphotypes. Morphometric
                  measurements were taken on sclerotized parts of the attachment

                  morphometry within a host species, or between several host
                  species, was assessed using both exploratory analyses
                  (principal component analysis and clustering analysis) and
                  statistical tests. We showed that: (1) for three out of four
                  morphotypes, the global morphometry was significantly
                  different according to host species used, and (2) the
                  coexistence of two populations of Lamellodiscus elegans on
                  Diplodus sargus could reflect an ongoing intra-host speciation

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a
                  biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  a topical question in community ecology and results from both
                  ecological and evolutionary processes. At fine taxonomical
                  scales, ecological specialisation, i.e. organisms
                  preferentially exploiting a subset of available habitats, is
                  thought to be a driver promoting niche diversity. It is not
                  clear, however, how different mechanisms interact to shape
                  specialist-generalist coexistence.MethodsWe reconstruct the
                  structure of five bacteria-phage networks from soil isolates,
                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite
                  performance.ResultsWe show that the co-occurrence of species
                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model
                  analysis we show that infection strategies of the phages have
                  more explanatory power than bacterial defenses on key
                  structural features of these antagonistic
                  communities.ConclusionsWe report that generalists have more
                  impact on their hosts than specialists, even when the
                  phylogenetic heterogeneity of hosts is controlled for. We
                  discuss our results in the light of their implications for the
                  evolution of biotic interactions.},

                  central in community ecology. Its drivers in competitive
                  systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are
                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful
                  measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity
                  can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic
                  levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of
                  interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic
                  complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and
                  apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to
                  ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community
                  dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of
                  ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable
                  predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of
                  species, the structure of their interactions needs to be
                  accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

                  tool in community ecology. Because organisms with the same
                  lifestyle can still exhibit ecological differences, it is
                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be
                  described. Here we show that networks of hosts (mammals) and
                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to
                  include in ecological networks, which we discuss in the light

                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of
                  how modular the network is) and different module compositions
                  (i.e. different groups of species forming said modules). More

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the

                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional

                  predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging
                  ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why
                  species interact, as this will allow the development of
                  mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better
                  characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
                  existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that
                  the current conceptualization of species interaction networks
                  is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future
                  research must start to account for the intrinsic variability
                  of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex
                  networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
                  there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
                  properties related to the establishment of species
                  interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based
                  processes, we show that this new approach will improve our
                  predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how
                  species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
                  Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of
                  ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and
                  why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we
                  build on existing empirical literature to show that the same
                  species may happen to interact in different ways when their
                  local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or
                  when the environment affects either of these factors. We
                  discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing
                  frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species
                  interactions.},

                  functional diversity. Although theoretical studies indicate

                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application

                  such as virus–host infection networks. Statistical network
                  analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom
                  patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns
                  on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring
                  patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is
                  a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting
                  subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the
                  interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an
                  open‐source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of
                  bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat
                  enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a
                  bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire
                  network) to local (i.e. module‐level) scales – and
                  meta‐analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In
                  common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which
                  a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical

                  species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the
                  structure of these networks changes; this happens because
                  species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove
                  interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying
                  such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however,
                  remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of
                  ecological interactions share common evolutionary mechanisms
                  that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In
                  particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death
                  processes for species interactions describes the structure of
                  extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types

                  herbivory, parasitism, bacteriophagy, and pollination—only
                  differed in the position they occupy in the parameters’

                  parameters values between antagonistic and mutualistic
                  interactions. Our results provide a common modelling framework
                  for the evolution of ecological networks that we anticipate
                  will contribute to the greater consideration of the explicit
                  role played by species interactions in models of

                  generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a
                  given community. Different techniques have been devised to
                  predict species interactions using theoretical models or
                  abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach,
                  with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a
                  supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are
                  algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict
                  whether a customer will like a product given the preferences
                  of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are
                  well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they
                  focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a
                  predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey
                  around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881
                  possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results
                  for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a
                  supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can
                  predict interactions with high accuracy using only three
                  traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions
                  can be predicted without regard to the ecological community
                  given only three variables: body mass and two variables for
                  the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as
                  recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of
                  traits, using only information about other species'
                  interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as
                  random forests base their predictions on traits only but do
                  not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should
                  focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for
                  ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to
                  capture indirect relationships between species.},

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response
                  to different climate variables than do individual
                  species.LocationEurasia.Time period2000s.Major
                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to
                  β‐diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51
                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some
                  climatic variables that have no effect on species
                  distributions or dissimilarity.Main conclusionsSpecies
                  interactions capture some degree of variation that is not
                  apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this
                  system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in
                  different ways as a response to different environmental
                  factors, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss
                  the implications of this finding for the amount of information
                  that should be considered when measuring community
                  dissimilarity.},

                  range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding
                  the influence of several driving processes, we know little as
                  to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual
                  molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence
                  of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods
                  commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the
                  structure of community interaction matrices, so-called
                  bipartite networks, reflected observed co-evolutionary
                  dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not
                  have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a
                  consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one
                  previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and the other fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics.
                  Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary
                  time, but we found no evidence for a trade-off with impact on
                  bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage
                  showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence
                  that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular
                  changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor,
                  while bacteria co-evolving with the fluctuating selection
                  phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions
                  of the pilF gene associated with type IV pili. We conclude
                  that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is
                  not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary dynamics, and
                  discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was,
                  nevertheless, locally adapted.},

                  sparse matrices, are usually collected through observation
                  studies targeted at identifying species interactions. Due to
                  the extensive required sampling effort, species interaction
                  datasets usually contain many false negatives, often leading
                  to bias in derived descriptors. We show that a simple linear
                  filter can be used to detect false negatives by scoring
                  interactions based on the structure of the interaction
                  matrices. On 180 different datasets of various sizes,
                  sparsities and ecological interaction types, we found that on
                  average in about 75\% of the cases, a false negative
                  interaction got a higher score than a true negative
                  interaction. Furthermore, we show that this filter is very
                  robust, even when the interaction matrix contains a very large
                  number of false negatives. Our results demonstrate that

                  resulting in complete dissimilarity after approximately 2500
                  km. Our failure to detect a decay in network structural
                  similarity suggests the possibility that different host and
                  parasite species are filling the same functional roles in
                  interaction networks, or that variation in network similarity
                  may be better explained by other geographic variables or

                  implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing
                  journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely
                  requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that
                  they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience

  abstract     = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial
                  distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the
                  way species interact with one another, but only recently
                  community ecologists realized the need to document their
                  spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an
                  integrated approach, adopting the view that community
                  structure is best represented as a network of ecological
                  interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography
                  questions. We propose that the ecological niche should
                  encompass the effect of the environment on species
                  distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on
                  the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian
                  dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a
                  quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in
                  space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction
                  distribution modeling. We apply this framework to
                  host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two
                  aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation)
                  exert a strong imprint on species co‐occurrence, but not on
                  species interactions. Even where species co‐occur, interaction
                  proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to
                  variation in realized network structure. We also find that a
                  large majority of host‐parasite pairs are never found
                  together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their
                  probability to interact. This first attempt to explain
                  variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens
                  new perspectives at the interface of species distribution
                  modeling and community ecology.},

                  However, the accurate description of food webs requires
                  significant effort in time and resources, limiting their
                  widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods
                  allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy
                  variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently
                  described methods, as well as describe a composite model of
                  the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a
                  large, well‐described dataset. Both niche and neutral
                  processes are involved in determining whether or not two
                  species will form a feeding link in communities. Three
                  different models for determining niche constraints of feeding
                  interactions are compared, and all three models are extended
                  by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative
                  abundances. The three models compared here infer niche
                  processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local
                  species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a
                  composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all
                  three methods perform well at predicting individual species
                  interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up
                  to the network level, resulting in food web structure of
                  inferred networks being similar to their empirical
                  counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web
                  structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting
                  summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test
                  of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is
                  low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using
                  traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding
                  of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite
                  model of the two methods provides a framework for
                  investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait
                  distributions, and relative abundances, affect species
                  interactions, and network structure.},

                  that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes
                  shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic
                  structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is
                  contingent upon random chance, environmental filters and local
                  effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal
                  local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a
                  host–parasite system where species interactions vary
                  substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological
                  significance of individual interactions is maintained across
                  different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that
                  observed community variation at the local scale frequently
                  tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal.
                  When considered in terms of the interplay between community
                  ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate
                  that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to
                  show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even

                  increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The
                  abstraction of ecological systems - such as communities -
                  through networks of interactions between their components
                  indeed provides a way to summarize this information with
                  single objects. The methodological framework derived from
                  graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to
                  analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on
                  established ecological theories as well as tools to address
                  new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test
                  ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand,
                  adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver
                  their full potential and account for their limitations. Here,
                  we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches

                  far, with - what we believe to be - their appropriate uses and
                  potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all
                  methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are
                  robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a
                  brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to
                  build them in order to summarize ecological information of
                  different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the
                  types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer
                  from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis
                  testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the
                  organization of species interactions in a community yields
                  different network structures (e.g., more or less dense,
                  modular or nested), how different measures can be used to
                  describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to
                  compare communities based on these differences in structures.
                  Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to
                  describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of
                  species based on their position in the network and the
                  organization of their interactions as well as associated new
                  methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we
                  describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological
                  developments to address novel ecological questions.},

                  differ between ecosystems, there is growing evidence of
                  multiple ways in which they also exhibit common topological
                  properties. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we
                  postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions
                  underlying all ecological networks—a common substructure
                  within every network comprised of species playing similar
                  ecological roles—and a periphery of species whose
                  idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks.
                  To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to
                  investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from
                  multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant
                  differences in the way species in different ecosystems
                  interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then
                  show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of
                  interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that
                  identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the

                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic

                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions
                  should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an
                  effective comparison and integration across domains, and for
                  assessing whether or not to use functional diversity

                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and

                  provide to humans are largely dependent on complex
                  interactions between prey and predators. These are embedded in
                  a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a
                  cascade of events following perturbations such as species
                  extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the
                  characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo
                  sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination
                  of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the
                  distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale
                  shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that
                  the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in
                  biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the
                  warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the
                  inferred global metaweb of marine fish-that is, all possible
                  potential feeding links between co-occurring species-is highly
                  connected geographically with a low degree of spatial
                  modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea
                  surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In
                  contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have
                  greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to
                  species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems
                  are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations
                  because of high robustness at most locations.},

  abstract     = {The structure of ecological interactions is commonly
                  understood through analyses of interaction networks. However,
                  these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases with
                  respect to both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and
                  interactions (the links between nodes), because the
                  detectability of species and their interactions is highly
                  heterogeneous. These ecological and statistical issues
                  directly affect ecologists' abilities to accurately construct
                  ecological networks. However, statistical biases introduced by
                  sampling are difficult to quantify in the absence of full
                  knowledge of the underlying ecological network's structure. To
                  explore properties of large-scale ecological networks, we
                  developed the software EcoNetGen, which constructs and samples
                  networks with predetermined topologies. These networks may
                  represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and
                  types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks
                  with different mathematical sampling designs that correspond
                  to methods used in field observations. The observed networks
                  generated by each sampling process were then analyzed with
                  respect to the number of components, size of components and
                  other network metrics. We show that the sampling effort needed
                  to estimate underlying network properties depends strongly
                  both on the sampling design and on the underlying network
                  topology. In particular, networks with random or scale-free
                  modules require more complete sampling to reveal their
                  structure, compared to networks whose modules are nested or
                  bipartite. Overall, modules with nested structure were the
                  easiest to detect, regardless of the sampling design used.
                  Sampling a network starting with any species that had a high
                  degree (e.g., abundant generalist species) was consistently
                  found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network
                  structure. Because high-degree species tend to be generalists,
                  abundant in natural communities relative to specialists, and
                  connected to each other, sampling by degree may therefore be
                  common but unintentional in empirical sampling of networks.
                  Conversely, sampling according to module (representing
                  different interaction types or taxa) results in a rather
                  complete view of certain modules, but fails to provide a
                  complete picture of the underlying network. To reduce biases
                  introduced by sampling methods, we recommend that these
                  findings be incorporated into field design considerations for
                  projects aiming to characterize large species interaction
                  networks.},

                  task for public health professionals and epidemiologists.
                  Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly
                  generating datasets that are worth more than their component
                  parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free
                  approach which leverages information on the global community
                  of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of
                  pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise
                  dissimilarities between countries' pathogen communities and
                  pathogens' geographical distributions and uses these to
                  predict country-pathogen associations. We compare the success
                  rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence
                  and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number
                  of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g.
                  virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only
                  these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic
                  network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that
                  while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well
                  captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events
                  remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an
                  influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the
                  model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely
                  to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model
                  is able to use the information on the existing
                  country-pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly
                  well, suggesting the importance in considering information on
                  co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate
                  outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.},

                  planning for biodiversity maintenance. Yet methods to assess
                  connectivity are often limited, because simulating the
                  dispersal of many species is computationally prohibitive, and
                  current simulations make simplifying assumptions about
                  movement that are potentially erroneous. Here we show how
                  these limits can be circumvented and propose a novel framework
                  for the assessment of omnifunctional and omnidirectional
                  connectivity in a 28000 km2 area in the Laurentian region of
                  Québec, Canada. Our approach relies on (i) the use of
                  Omniscape, an improved version of Circuitscape which allows
                  omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal
                  movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of
                  species-level dispersal simulations through a posteriori
                  clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that
                  the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into
                  three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly
                  aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic
                  environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These
                  functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots,
                  suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for
                  the multiplicity of dispersal strategies. Although this
                  approach requires a large volume of computing resources, it
                  provides richer information on which landscape features are
                  critical to maintain or need to be regenerated for broader

                  food-chain analyses have focused on investigating the
                  consequences of these changes on ecosystem processes and the
                  resulting functions. These different and diverging conceptual
                  frameworks have each produced important results and identified
                  a set of important mechanisms, that shape ecosystem functions.
                  But the disconnection between these frameworks, and the
                  various simplifications of the study systems are not
                  representative of the complexity of real-world communities.
                  Here we use food webs as a more realistic depiction of
                  communities, and use a bioenergetic model to simulate their
                  biomass dynamics and quantify the resulting flows and stocks
                  of biomass. We use tools from food web analysis to investigate
                  how the predictions from BEF and food-chain analyses fit
                  together, how they correlate to food-web structure and how it
                  might help us understand the interplay between various drivers
                  of ecosystem functioning. We show that food web structure is
                  correlated to the community’s efficiency in storing the
                  captured biomass, which may explain the distribution of
                  biomass (top heaviness) across the different trophic
                  compartments (producers, primary and secondary consumers).
                  While we know that ecological network structure is important
                  in shaping ecosystem dynamics, identifying structural
                  attributes important in shaping ecosystem processes and
                  synthesizing how it affects various underpinning mechanisms
                  may help prioritize key conservation targets to protect not
                  only biodiversity but also its structure and the resulting

                  elusive. Primarily, complexity has been defined on the basis
                  of the structural (or behavioural) complexity of the system.
                  These definitions ignore the notion of “physical complexity,”
                  which can measure the amount of information contained in an
                  ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress.
                  We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as
                  measures of “external” and “internal” complexity,
                  respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find
                  that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical
                  complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more
                  complex when compared to other types of interactions. In
                  addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural
                  measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral

                  measure of network complexity and should be added to the

                  expanding, motivated in part by concerns around emerging
                  zoonoses. One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus
                  association data, which underpin viral macroecology and
                  zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous
                  data portals. In the present article, we propose that
                  synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to
                  characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory
                  in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open
                  database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles
                  four published data sets. We show that this offers a

                  these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery

                  processes, but comprehensively sampling these interactions is
                  difficult. Interactions intrinsically vary across space and
                  time, and given the number of species that compose ecological
                  communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true
                  negative (where two species never interact) from a false
                  negative (where two species have not been observed interacting
                  even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of
                  interactions between species is an imperative for several
                  fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions
                  between species-and to describe the structure, variation, and
                  change of the ecological networks they form-we need to rely on
                  modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we
                  show how a simple neural network model makes accurate
                  predictions about species interactions given limited data. We
                  then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with
                  improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual

                  networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude

                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets

                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of

                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an
                  unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global
                  virome.},

                  defined two‐dimensional landscape. This is achieved by
                  calculating the rate and direction of change through the
                  interpolation of points. This not only gives an approximation
                  as to the shape of the landscape but can also be used to
                  identify candidate boundaries cells that delimit a shift from
                  one state to another within the landscape. Here we introduce
                  the SpatialBoundaries.jl package for Julia, which has been
                  developed to implement the wombling algorithm for datasets
                  that are spatially referenced for both uniformly or randomly
                  sampled landscapes. From a practical perspective, the wombling
                  functionality allow the user to answer two questions: how much
                  and in which direction does the variable of interest change
                  within the landscape? Whereas the boundaries functionality
                  identifies candidate boundary cells. We conclude by providing
                  a working example of the package using the various woody plant

                  species pool) are a powerful abstraction to understand how
                  large‐scale species interaction networks are structured.
                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and
                  taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly
                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the
                  limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first
                  approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to
                  predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using
                  graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species
                  interactions. Graph embedding is an emerging field in machine
                  learning that holds great potential for ecological problems.

                  networks created by different sets of researchers to test
                  their hypotheses regarding how ecological processes drive
                  network topology. Yet, topological properties identified
                  across these networks may not be sufficiently attributable to
                  ecological processes alone as often assumed. Instead, much of
                  the totality of topological differences between
                  networks-topological heterogeneity-could be due to variations
                  in research designs and approaches that different researchers
                  use to create each species interaction network. To evaluate
                  the degree to which this topological heterogeneity is present
                  in available ecological networks, we first compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity across 723 species interaction
                  networks created by different sets of researchers with the
                  amount quantified from non-ecological networks known to be
                  constructed following more consistent approaches. Then, to
                  further test whether the topological heterogeneity was due to
                  differences in study designs, and not only to inherent
                  variation within ecological networks, we compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity between species interaction
                  networks created by the same sets of researchers (i.e.,
                  networks from the same publication) with the amount quantified
                  between networks that were each from a unique publication
                  source. We found that species interaction networks are highly
                  topologically heterogeneous: while species interaction
                  networks from the same publication are much more topologically
                  similar to each other than interaction networks that are from
                  a unique publication, they still show at least twice as much
                  heterogeneity as any category of non-ecological networks that
                  we tested. Altogether, our findings suggest that extra care is
                  necessary to effectively analyze species interaction networks
                  created by different researchers, perhaps by controlling for
                  the publication source of each network.},

                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

                  the global biogeography of bat-origin betacoronaviruses, and
                  find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of
                  risk that are distinct from the hotspots and coldspots of host
                  richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a
                  unique pool of merbecoviruses in the Neotropics, a recently
                  discovered lineage of divergent nobecoviruses in Madagascar,
                  and-most importantly-hotspots of diversification in southeast
                  Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East that correspond
                  to the site of previous zoonotic emergence events. Our
                  framework may help identify hotspots of future risk that have
                  also been previously overlooked, like West Africa and the
                  Indian subcontinent, and may more broadly help researchers
                  understand how host ecology shapes the evolution and diversity
                  of pandemic threats.},

                  its direct effect on biological rates such as respiration and

                  ecologically processes by altering trophic dynamics, the
                  persistence of a species in a given environment, and,
                  consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if
                  this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
                  singularly the most important factor for the functioning of
                  ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a
                  species to the local environment also play an essential role.
                  Understanding the relative importance of these factors is
                  crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will
                  have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more complete
                  understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is
                  necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as
                  the influences of species distribution and local adaptation,
                  with ecosystem and community ecology. By using the microbial
                  community inhabiting the water-filled leaves of Sarracenia
                  purpurea, we tested the importance of temperature, trophic
                  structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem functioning. We
                  accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural
                  temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
                  common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the
                  importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of
                  each community was crossed with the temperature from each
                  site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic
                  regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the
                  mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found that
                  temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
                  origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with
                  temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of
                  temperature and biotic interactions when predicting the

                  Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate

                  climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease
                  and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively
                  quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show
                  significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis,
                  tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection,
                  cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related
                  to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven
                  results are consistent with previous reasoning-based
                  propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing
                  threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and
                  leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with
                  increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and

                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  to greenhouse gas emissions and will continue to change over
                  this century, accelerating without effective global efforts to
                  reduce emissions. Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are
                  inherently climate-sensitive due to the sensitivity of tick
                  lifecycles to climate. Key direct climate and weather
                  sensitivities include survival of individual ticks, and the
                  duration of development and host-seeking activity of ticks.
                  These sensitivities mean that in some regions a warming
                  climate may increase tick survival, shorten life-cycles and
                  lengthen the duration of tick activity seasons. Indirect
                  effects of climate change on host communities may, with
                  changes in tick abundance, facilitate enhanced transmission of
                  tick-borne pathogens. High temperatures, and extreme weather
                  events (heat, cold, and flooding) are anticipated with climate
                  change, and these may reduce tick survival and pathogen
                  transmission in some locations. Studies of the possible
                  effects of climate change on TTBDs to date generally project
                  poleward range expansion of geographical ranges (with possible
                  contraction of ranges away from the increasingly hot tropics),
                  upslope elevational range spread in mountainous regions, and
                  increased abundance of ticks in many current endemic regions.
                  However, relatively few studies, using long-term
                  (multi-decade) observations, provide evidence of recent range
                  changes of tick populations that could be attributed to recent
                  climate change. Further integrated 'One Health' observational
                  and modeling studies are needed to detect changes in TTBD
                  occurrence, attribute them to climate change, and to develop
                  predictive models of public- and animal-health needs to plan
                  for TTBD emergence.},

                  should favor specialists because there are tradeoffs limiting
                  the fitness of generalists in any of the alternative hosts or
                  because evolution proceeds faster with narrower niches. Here
                  we review experiments showing that virus adaptation to a
                  specific host is often coupled with fitness losses in
                  alternative ones. In most instances, mutations beneficial in
                  one host are detrimental in another. This antagonistic
                  pleiotropy should limit the range of adaptation and promote
                  the evolution of specialization. However, when hosts fluctuate
                  in time or space, selective pressures are different and

                  host types. We have particularly explored under which

                  coexist with specialist strains or even dominate the
                  population. By means of a nonlinear mathematical model and

                  provided biological interpretation in terms of the infection
                  rates for the viral specialist and generalist strains. By

                  purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in
                  related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects

                  our understanding of the ecology and evolution of infectious
                  diseases. Fluctuating transmission of severe acute respiratory
                  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demonstrated the highly
                  dynamic nature of human social behavior, often without
                  government intervention. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the first
                  two years following spillover resulted primarily in increased
                  transmissibility, while in the third year, the globally
                  dominant virus variants had all evolved substantial immune
                  evasion. The combination of viral evolution and the buildup of
                  host immunity through vaccination and infection greatly
                  decreased the realized virulence of SARS-CoV-2 due to the age
                  dependence of disease severity. The COVID-19 pandemic was
                  exacerbated by presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and highly
                  heterogeneous transmission, as well as highly variable disease
                  severity and the broad host range of SARS-CoV-2. Insights and

                  in need of assistance. In the absence of suitable conservation
                  interventions, they are likely to disappear soon1. There is
                  limited understanding of how and where conservation
                  interventions are applied globally, or how well they work2,3.
                  Here, using information from the International Union for
                  Conservation of Nature Red List and other global databases, we
                  find that for species at risk from three of the biggest
                  drivers of biodiversity loss—habitat loss, overexploitation
                  for international trade and invasive species4—many appear to
                  lack the appropriate types of conservation interventions.
                  Indeed, although there has been substantial recent expansion
                  of the protected area network, we still find that 91\% of
                  threatened species have insufficient representation of their
                  habitats within protected areas. Conservation interventions
                  are not implemented uniformly across different taxa and
                  regions and, even when present, have infrequently led to
                  substantial improvements in the status of species. For 58\% of
                  the world’s threatened terrestrial species, we find
                  conservation interventions to be notably insufficient or
                  absent. We cannot determine whether such species are truly
                  neglected, or whether efforts to recover them are not included
                  in major conservation databases. If they are indeed neglected,
                  the outlook for many of the world’s threatened species is grim
                  without more and better targeted action.},

                  viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address
                  the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to
                  host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents,
                  another important host order. We found that bats indeed host
                  more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we
                  identified life-history and ecological factors that promote
                  zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by
                  species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of
                  other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry).
                  Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased
                  zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one
                  young), greater longevity and more litters per year.
                  Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain
                  in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the
                  stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared
                  between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission
                  is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats
                  host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of
                  zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in
                  rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the
                  number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents
                  should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging
                  viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and
                  perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive
                  framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus

                  independently developed in mammals. Flight is among the most
                  energy-consuming activities. Thus, we deduced that changes in
                  energy metabolism must be a primary factor in the origin of
                  flight in bats. The respiratory chain of the mitochondrial
                  produces 95\% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) needed for
                  locomotion. Because the respiratory chain has a dual genetic
                  foundation, with genes encoded by both the mitochondrial and
                  nuclear genomes, we examined both genomes to gain insights
                  into the evolution of flight within mammals. Evidence for
                  positive selection was detected in 23.08\% of the
                  mitochondrial-encoded and 4.90\% of nuclear-encoded oxidative
                  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, but in only 2.25\% of the
                  nuclear-encoded nonrespiratory genes that function in
                  mitochondria or 1.005\% of other nuclear genes in bats. To
                  address the caveat that the two available bat genomes are of
                  only draft quality, we resequenced 77 OXPHOS genes from four
                  species of bats. The analysis of the resequenced gene data are
                  in agreement with our conclusion that a significantly higher
                  proportion of genes involved in energy metabolism, compared
                  with background genes, show evidence of adaptive evolution
                  specific on the common ancestral bat lineage. Both
                  mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes display
                  evidence of adaptive evolution along the common ancestral
                  branch of bats, supporting our hypothesis that genes involved
                  in energy metabolism were targets of natural selection and
                  allowed adaptation to the huge change in energy demand that
                  were required during the origin of flight.},

                  in the Americas, i.e. New World Hantaviruses (NWH). First, we
                  considered the circulation of pathogenic NWH among Cricetidae
                  rodents, by inferring the phylogenetic links among 277 genomic
                  samples of the S segment (N protein) of NWH found in 55
                  species. Second, we used machine learning to assess the impact
                  of land use on the probability of presence of the rodent
                  species linked with reservoirs of pathogenic Hantaviruses. Our
                  results show that hosts are widely present across the

                  agricultural land, but not in the secondary forest, whereas
                  other hosts are present in secondary forest and agricultural
                  land. The diversity of host species allows Hantavirus to
                  circulate in a wide spectrum of habitats, in particular rural
                  rather than urban. We highlight that public repositories of

                  abundant near poultry farms, and have been linked to outbreaks
                  of AIVs in poultry. Interspecific and seasonal variation in
                  waterfowl movement and habitat use means that the risk of
                  disease transmission between wild birds and poultry inevitably
                  varies across species, space, and time. Here, we used GPS
                  telemetry data from 10 waterfowl species in and near
                  California's Central Valley, a region where both wild
                  waterfowl and domestic poultry are abundant, to study
                  selection of poultry farms by waterfowl across diel, seasonal,
                  and annual cycles. We found that waterfowl selected for
                  wetlands, open water, protected areas, and croplands, which
                  meant that they generally avoided habitats that were likely to
                  be used for poultry farming. These selection patterns were
                  linked to species' ecology and diel behavioral patterns, such
                  that avoidance of poultry habitats was stronger for local or
                  partial migrants than for long‐distance migrants, and stronger
                  during daytime than at night. We then combined these habitat
                  selection results with data on poultry farm locations to map
                  risk of waterfowl–poultry contact across the Central Valley.
                  Average selection strength at poultry farms was low,
                  suggesting that current placement of poultry farms is
                  generally effective for limiting risk of contact with wild
                  birds. When we combined these habitat selection results with
                  data on species' abundances and AIV infection prevalence, we
                  found dramatic variation in potential AIV transmission risk
                  among species. These results could be used to prioritize
                  surveillance and biosecurity efforts for regions and times of
                  relatively high risk. More generally, these results highlight
                  that fine‐scale movement data can help identify interspecific,
                  seasonal, and diel patterns in animal behaviors that affect
                  wildlife and poultry health.},

                  climate and the northern expansion of the distribution of D.

  abstract     = {Symbionts tend to be aggregated on their hosts, such that few
                  hosts harbor the majority of symbionts. This ubiquitous
                  pattern can result from stochastic processes, but aggregation
                  patterns may also depend on the type of host–symbiont
                  interaction, along with traits that affect host exposure and
                  susceptibility to symbionts. Untangling how aggregation
                  patterns both within and among populations depend on
                  stochastic processes, interaction type and host traits remains
                  an outstanding challenge. Here, we address this challenge by
                  using null models to compare aggregation patterns in a neutral
                  system of Balanomorpha barnacles attached to patellid limpets
                  and a host–parasite system of Gyrodactylus spp. monogeneans
                  and their Trinidadian guppy Poecilia reticulata hosts. We
                  first used a model to predict patterns of symbiont–host
                  aggregation due to random partitioning of symbionts to hosts.
                  This null model accurately predicted the aggregation of
                  barnacles on limpets, but the degree of aggregation varied
                  across 303 quadrats. Quadrats with larger limpets had less
                  aggregated barnacles, whereas aggregation increased with
                  variation in limpet size. Across 84 guppy populations,
                  Gyrodactylus spp. parasites were significantly less aggregated
                  than predicted by the null model. As in the neutral
                  limpet–barnacle system, aggregation decreased with mean host
                  size. Parasites were significantly less aggregated on males
                  than females because male guppies tended to have higher
                  prevalence and lower parasite burdens than predicted by the
                  null model. Together, these results suggest stochastic
                  processes can explain aggregation patterns in neutral but not
                  parasitic systems, though in both systems host traits affect
                  aggregation patterns. Because the distribution of symbionts on
                  hosts can affect symbiont evolution via intraspecific
                  interactions, and host behavior and evolution via
                  host–symbiont interactions, identifying the drivers of
                  aggregation enriches our understanding of host–symbiont

                  forests are simultaneously attacked by multiple pathogens.
                  Usually, the impacts of each pathogen are studied separately,
                  however, interactions between them can affect disease
                  dynamics. Pathogens can interact directly by competing for the
                  same niche, but also facilitate or suppress each other via
                  indirect effects through the host. We studied 66 native
                  Mediterranean Pinus nigra stands located in the Pyrenees which
                  were affected by two pathogens with different structural
                  specificity: Dothistroma pini causing Dothistroma needle
                  blight and Diplodia sapinea causing Diplodia shoot blight. We
                  explored the ecology of both pathogens and whether the
                  diseases they caused had an impact on trees and recruits. No
                  signs of competition were found on adult trees. Diplodia shoot
                  blight was restricted to the warmest and driest areas, while
                  no climatic restrictions were identified for Dothistroma
                  needle blight. Both diseases caused additive effects on crown
                  defoliation and defoliated trees showed stagnated growth. In
                  the regeneration layer, signs of disease suppression were
                  found. In the warmest and driest areas, seedling mortality was
                  mainly associated with Diplodia shoot blight, even though both
                  pathogens were detected. Clear signs of D. pini spillover from
                  canopy trees to recruits were found. However, seedling
                  mortality caused by Dothistroma needle blight was only
                  restricted to the coldest and wettest sites where D. sapinea
                  could not survive. Large crowns in adult trees probably allow
                  both pathogens to co‐exist and cause additive impacts. The
                  smaller size of recruits and a higher susceptibility to
                  environmental stress compared to adult trees probably
                  facilitates the effects of Diplodia shoot blight which masked
                  those caused by Dothistroma needle blight. By considering
                  climatic constraints, host ontogeny and structural
                  specificity, we could dissect the disease impacts of two

                  epidemiology of a plant disease and in the microevolution of
                  its causative pathogen. In California and southern Oregon
                  (USA), the introduction of the invasive pathogen Phytophthora
                  ramorum, causal agent of the widespread disease Sudden Oak
                  Death (SOD), has resulted in extensive mortality of various
                  oaks Quercus sp. and of tanoak Notholithocarpus densiflorus.
                  Although the disease can infect over a hundred hosts,
                  California bay laurel Umbellularia californica is the most
                  competent transmissive host but is not lethally affected by
                  the disease. Using population genetics data, we identify the
                  relationship among P. ramorum populations in bay laurels, oaks
                  and tanoaks to clarify the contribution of each host on the
                  epidemiology of SOD and on the microevolution of its causal
                  agent and to explore differences in population structure
                  across sites and years. We conclude that bay laurel is the
                  primary source for infections of both tanoak and oak, and that
                  tanoak contributes minimally to oak infection but can infect
                  bay laurel, creating a secondary pathogen amplification
                  process. Overall, pathogen diversity is associated with
                  rainfall and presence of bay laurels, which sustain the
                  largest populations of the pathogen. Additionally, we clarify
                  that while bay laurels are a common source of inoculum, oaks
                  and tanoaks act as sinks that maintain host‐specific pathogen
                  genotypes not observed in bay laurel populations. Finally, we
                  conclude that different sites support a dominance of different
                  pathogen genotypes. Some genotypes were widespread, while
                  others were limited to a subset of the plots. Sites with
                  higher bay laurel densities sustained a higher genotypic
                  diversity of the pathogen. This work provides novel insight

                  transmission of pathogens between managed and wild bees are
                  prominent. In this context, most research efforts have focused

                  on the functioning of plant–pollinator interactions in

                  emergent pathogen Vairimorpha ceranae in Mediterranean wild
                  bee communities inhabiting landscapes with varying levels of

                  sampled in nine one‐hectare plots along a gradient of land use
                  (urban structures, croplands and natural vegetation) and
                  beekeeping intensity. We analysed the impact of human
                  disturbances on pollination networks and pathogen prevalence,
                  and applied a network approach to examine whether total
                  effects of species in networks (i.e. direct plus indirect
                  interactions) explain pathogen spread through bee
                  communities.We found that V. ceranae prevalence in honey bees
                  is not a good predictor of the pathogen spread through bee
                  communities. There seems to be a temporal mismatch between
                  pathogen dynamics in managed and wild bees. Networks with more
                  diversity of interactions and more plants showed less pathogen
                  prevalence, but total effect analyses (i.e. combining direct
                  and indirect interactions) failed to explain pathogen
                  transmission across pollination networks. Croplands increased
                  wild bee density, and interactions and species diversity in
                  networks, while shrublands had the opposite effect. Our

                  co-occurrence, diversity patterns, biogeographic
                  regionalisation). Even in a highly globalized world most human
                  infectious diseases remain constrained in their geographic
                  distributions by ecological barriers to the dispersal or
                  establishment of their causal pathogens, reservoir hosts
                  and/or vectors. These same processes underpin the spatial
                  arrangement of other taxa, such as mammalian biodiversity,
                  providing a strong empirical 'prior' with which to assess the
                  potential distributions of infectious diseases when data on
                  their occurrence is unavailable or limited. In the absence of
                  quality data, generalized biogeographic patterns could provide
                  the earliest (and in some cases the only) insights into the
                  potential distributions of many poorly known or emerging, or
                  as-yet-unknown, infectious disease risks. Encouraging more
                  community ecologists and biogeographers to collaborate with
                  health professionals (and vice versa) has the potential to
                  improve our understanding of infectious disease systems and
                  identify novel management strategies to improve local, global
                  and planetary health.},

                  by >3.6 million hectares (ha) during 2001-2004. Whether this
                  cropland expansion resulted from intensified use of land
                  previously cleared for cattle ranching or new deforestation
                  has not been quantified and has major implications for future
                  deforestation dynamics, carbon fluxes, forest fragmentation,
                  and other ecosystem services. We combine deforestation maps,
                  field surveys, and satellite-based information on vegetation
                  phenology to characterize the fate of large (>25-ha) clearings
                  as cropland, cattle pasture, or regrowing forest in the years
                  after initial clearing in Mato Grosso, the Brazilian state
                  with the highest deforestation rate and soybean production
                  since 2001. Statewide, direct conversion of forest to cropland
                  totaled >540,000 ha during 2001-2004, peaking at 23\% of 2003
                  annual deforestation. Cropland deforestation averaged twice
                  the size of clearings for pasture (mean sizes, 333 and 143 ha,
                  respectively), and conversion occurred rapidly; >90\% of
                  clearings for cropland were planted in the first year after
                  deforestation. Area deforested for cropland and mean annual
                  soybean price in the year of forest clearing were directly
                  correlated (R(2) = 0.72), suggesting that deforestation rates
                  could return to higher levels seen in 2003-2004 with a rebound
                  of crop prices in international markets. Pasture remains the
                  dominant land use after forest clearing in Mato Grosso, but
                  the growing importance of larger and faster conversion of
                  forest to cropland defines a new paradigm of forest loss in
                  Amazonia and refutes the claim that agricultural
                  intensification does not lead to new deforestation.},

                  pandemics is currently unpredictable but depends on ecological
                  and virological factors. The host range of an influenza A
                  virus is determined by species-specific interactions between
                  virus and host cell factors. These include the ability to bind

                  anthropological response and describes the protagonists,
                  interventions, and priorities for anthropological engagement.
                  It takes an inclusive approach to anthropological praxis by
                  engaging with the work of nonanthropologist “allies,”
                  including qualitative researchers, social workers, and allied
                  experts. The article narrates how the concept of
                  “anthropology” came to serve as a semantic marker of
                  solidarity with local populations, respect for customary
                  practices and local sociopolitical realities, and an avowed
                  belief in the capacities of local populations to lead

                  from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public
                  health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic
                  spillover requires several factors to align, including the
                  ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of
                  pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect

                  propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission
                  that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework
                  reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a
                  hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections
                  in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally

                  these regions, pteropodids have been identified as natural
                  reservoir hosts for henipaviruses. The genus Henipavirus
                  includes Hendra virus and Nipah virus, which regularly spill
                  over from bats to domestic animals and humans in Australia and
                  Asia, and a suite of largely uncharacterized African
                  henipaviruses. Rapid change in fruit bat habitat and

                  production, and needing more animals to feed it. Emerging
                  infectious diseases are increasing, causing losses in both
                  human and animal lives, as well as large costs to society.
                  Many factors are contributing to disease emergence, including
                  climate change, globalization and urbanization, and most of
                  these factors are to some extent caused by humans. Pathogens
                  may be more or less prone to emergence in themselves, and
                  rapidly mutating viruses are more common among the emerging
                  pathogens. The climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are
                  likely to be emerging due to climate changes and environmental
                  changes, such as increased irrigation. This review lists the
                  factors within pathogens that make them prone to emergence,
                  and the modes of transmission that are affected. The
                  anthropogenic changes contributing to disease emergence are

                  have multiple direct or indirect effects, and it may be
                  difficult to assess what the consequences may be. In addition,

                  necessary to identify suitable interventions to mitigate the
                  risk of disease emergence. To achieve this, interfaces must be
                  studied as complex, multihost communities whose structure and
                  form are dictated by both ecological and anthropological
                  factors.},

                  and livestock as they relate to wildlife has increased greatly
                  over the past several decades. Many factors, most
                  anthropogenic, have facilitated the emergence of diseases from
                  wildlife. Some livestock diseases have "spilled over" to
                  wildlife and then "spilled back" to livestock. When a
                  population is exposed to an infectious agent, depending on an
                  interaction of factors involving the host, agent, and
                  environment, the population may be resistant to infection or
                  may become a dead-end host, a spillover host, or a maintenance
                  host. Each exposure is unique; the same species of host and
                  agent may respond differently in different situations.
                  Management actions that affect the environment and behavior of
                  a potential host animal may allow the emergence of a new or as
                  yet undetected disease. There are many barriers in preventing,
                  detecting, monitoring and managing wildlife diseases. These
                  may include political and legal hurdles, lack of knowledge
                  about many diseases of wildlife, the absence of basic data on
                  wildlife populations, difficulties with surveillance, and
                  logistical constraints. Increasing interaction between
                  wildlife and humans or domestic animals may lead to disease
                  emergence and require innovative methods and strategies for

                  with predators consuming increasingly larger prey and feeding
                  at higher trophic levels as they grow. Gape limitation and
                  ontogenetic diet shifts are key mechanisms by which size
                  structuring arises in these communities. Little is known,
                  however, about size structuring in coral reef fishes. Here, we
                  aimed to advance understanding of size structuring in coral
                  reef food webs by examining the evidence for these mechanisms
                  in two groups of reef predators. Given the diversity of
                  feeding modes amongst coral reef fishes, we also compared gape
                  size-body size allometric relationships across functional
                  groups to determine whether they are reliable indicators of
                  size structuring. We used gut content analysis and quantile
                  regressions of predator size-prey size relationships to test
                  for evidence of gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts
                  in reef piscivores (n = 13 species) and benthic invertivores
                  (n = 3 species). We then estimated gape size-body size
                  allometric scaling coefficients for 21 different species from
                  four functional groups, including herbivores/detritivores,
                  which are not expected to be gape-limited. We found evidence
                  of both mechanisms for size structuring in coral reef
                  piscivores, with maximum prey size scaling positively with
                  predator body size, and ontogenetic diet shifts including prey
                  type and expansion of prey size. There was, however, little
                  evidence of size structuring in benthic invertivores. Across
                  species and functional groups, absolute and relative gape
                  sizes were largest in piscivores as expected, but gape
                  size-body size scaling relationships were not indicative of
                  size structuring. Instead, relative gape sizes and mouth
                  morphologies may be better indicators. Our results provide
                  evidence that coral reef piscivores are size-structured and
                  that gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts are the
                  mechanisms from which this structure arises. Although gape
                  allometry was not indicative of size structuring, it may have
                  implications for ecosystem function: positively allometric
                  gape size-body size scaling relationships in
                  herbivores/detritivores suggests that loss of large-bodied
                  individuals of these species will have a disproportionately
                  negative impact on reef grazing pressure.},

                  single agency issues that require intervention or monitoring
                  at one spatial scale. A master sample can be used to
                  coordinate and scale monitoring designs to ensure consistency
                  in information gathered and robustness of estimators at the
                  different spatial scales. We propose using balanced acceptance
                  sampling (BAS) to generate a master sample. In this context,
                  practical applications and justification of BAS as a master
                  sample are addressed. These include sample generation,
                  stratification, unequal probability sampling, rotating panel
                  designs, and regional intensification. A method for
                  incorporating legacy sites is also provided. Using BAS as a
                  master sample is conceptually simple, gives good spatial
                  balance over different spatial scales, and is computationally
                  efficient to generate. An example for terrestrial biodiversity
                  monitoring in New Zealand is provided. Environmental
                  monitoring can benefit from increased coordination between
                  agencies. A master sample is an excellent way to incorporate
                  coordination directly into the sample design. BAS improves on
                  methods previously described and provides an effective method

                  for specific leaf area (SLA) available within the largest and
                  most frequently used global plant trait database, the TRY
                  Plant Trait Database, exploring how much of the data were
                  applicable (i.e., original, representative, logical, and
                  comparable) and traceable (i.e., published, cited, and
                  consistent). Over three‐quarters of the SLA data in TRY either
                  lacked applicability or traceability, leaving only 22.9\% of
                  the original data usable compared with the 64.9\% typically
                  deemed usable by standard data cleaning protocols. The

  abstract  = {Ecosystems are composed of networks of interacting species. These
               interactions allow communities of species to persist through time
               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

                  infectious diseases, for instance by affecting individual
                  interactions. Increasing the knowledge of individual movement
                  patterns can provide better insight into disease prevalence
                  and spread, helping to target efforts to minimise disease
                  outbreaks. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion
                  disease affecting cervids. CWD is transmitted by
                  animal‐to‐animal contact and through the environment, thus
                  individual variation in space use and social associations may
                  influence disease transmission patterns and infection risk.
                  CWD was detected in Norwegian alpine reindeer Rangifer
                  tarandus tarandus in 2016, and eradication of the infected
                  population was implemented. A 3:1 infection rate between males
                  and females suggests sex‐specific behavioural drivers. We
                  utilised an extensive individual‐based dataset of 149
                  GPS‐marked wild reindeer to investigate individual variation
                  in movement patterns in terms of inter‐ and intra‐annual home
                  range size and site fidelity, and variation in home range
                  overlap and distances between individuals. We aimed to
                  identify patterns which could indicate higher potential
                  disease risk. Females had larger annual and seasonal home
                  ranges than males, except during calving and rut. Greater home
                  range overlaps and shorter between‐individual distances were
                  found between same‐sex individuals than different‐sex
                  individuals, except during the rut. Accordingly, the rut
                  season stands out with greater male home ranges, greater home
                  range overlap and shorter distances between males and between
                  males and females, which could indicate that this season is
                  critical for disease transmission. Measures to prevent disease
                  spread should lower contact rates, e.g. by reducing the
                  abundance of adult males before they mix with other groups
                  during the rut. This can be achieved for instance by allowing
                  earlier hunt on adult males when they are distributed in small
                  male groups, to reduce the transmission risk and keep
                  disturbance of other individuals low.},

                  a diverse set of taxa, a related macroecological pattern, the
                  latitudinal specialization gradient (LSG), remains
                  controversial. A classical expectation is that species should
                  present more specialized interactions towards the equator,
                  however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence for
                  this hypothesis. Here, we tested the LSG in a set of
                  bird–malarial parasite networks across South America. Our
                  analyses comprise 9763 individual birds surveyed in 52
                  communities, within eight biomes and spanning a gradient of
                  4700 km. We measured network‐level specialization through
                  indices that account for increasingly comprehensive
                  information. Binary specialization considers the
                  occurrence/absence of interactions between each host–parasite
                  pair; quantitative specialization is also affected by the
                  frequency of interactions between each host–parasite pair; and
                  phylogenetic specialization takes into account the phylogeny
                  and abundances of host species. We found that, while binary
                  specialization increases towards the equator, quantitative
                  specialization decreases. Thus, despite each parasite lineage
                  infecting a more restricted set from the available host
                  species in low latitudes, infections were more evenly
                  distributed among host species, than in higher latitudes.
                  Additionally, using a structural equation model, we show that
                  both direct and indirect effects contribute to this unexpected
                  relationship. Direct effects are weak, and
                  network‐specialization was mostly explained by host species
                  and parasite lineage richness, evidencing that changes in
                  network specialization along latitude are in a large part
                  explained by the latitudinal diversity gradient for birds and
                  malarial‐parasites. In the light of the accumulated evidence
                  over the past years, reinforced by our findings, we suggest
                  that the classical latitudinal specialization hypothesis
                  should be reevaluated, making room for a theoretical framework
                  able to encompass the conflicting results.},
