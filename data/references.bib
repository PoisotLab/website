                  J.; Hortal, Joaquin | Abstract: Species are the currency of
                  most biodiversity studies. However, many shortfalls and biases
                  remain in our biodiversity estimates, preventing a
                  comprehensive understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes
                  that have shaped the biodiversity currently available on
                  Earth. Biased biodiversity estimates also jeopardize the
                  effective implementation of data-driven conservation
                  strategies, ultimately leading to biodiversity loss. Here, we
                  delve into the concept of the Latitudinal Taxonomy Gradient
                  (LTG) and show how this new idea provides an interesting
                  conceptual link between the Linnean (i.e., our ignorance of
                  how many species there are on Earth), Darwinian (i.e., our
                  ignorance of species evolutionary relationships), and
                  Wallacean (i.e., our ignorance on species distribution)
                  shortfalls. More specifically, we contribute to an improved
                  understanding of LTGs and establish the basis for the
                  development of new methods that allow us to: (i) better
                  account for the integration between different shortfalls and,
                  (ii) estimate how these interactions may affect our
                  understanding about the evolutionary components of richness
                  gradients at macroecological scales.},

               rabies, primarily because the disease is economically very
               important and vampire bat control is the key to eliminating the
               problem. Less appreciated is the increased abundance of the
               common vampire bat in tropical America, brought about by man's
               activities. The principal reason to control vampire bats is their
               role as a vector of rabies and their predation on domestic
               animals. In 1972 two new vampire bat control methods, based on
               two different applications of an anticoagulant were described.
               These methods, one topical, the second systemic, if properly
               applied, have removed the risk of traumatic death to operators
               and are relatively species-specific in killing vampire bats. With
               the exception of the strychnine technique, previous methods for
               controlling vampires required knowing the location of their
               roosts. It is not necessary to know the location of the roosts,
               and it is likely that several nearby vampire colonies are being
               destroyed simultaneously.},

                  change. During the 20th century, biodiversity declined

                  Provisioning ecosystem services increased several fold, and

                  policies toward sustainability have the potential to slow

                  for understanding and predicting biodiversity change, and
                  recent work has emphasised the importance of understanding how
                  species distributions change over both time and space.
                  Spatio‐temporal models require large amounts of data spread
                  over time and space, and as such are clear candidates to
                  benefit from model‐based integration of different data
                  sources. However, spatio‐temporal models are highly
                  computationally intensive and integrating different data
                  sources can make this approach even more unfeasible to
                  ecologists. Here we demonstrate how the R‐INLA methodology can
                  be used for model‐based data integration for spatio‐temporally
                  explicit modelling of species distribution change. We
                  demonstrate that this method can be applied to both point and
                  areal data with two contrasting case studies, one using the
                  SPDE approach for modelling spatio‐temporal change in the
                  Gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus) across Great Britain
                  and the second using a spatio‐temporal areal model to describe
                  change in caddisfly (Trichoptera) populations across the River
                  Thames catchment. We show that in the caddisfly case study
                  integrating together different data sources led to greater
                  understanding of the change in abundance across the River
                  Thames both seasonally and over 5 years of data. However, in
                  the butterfly case study moving to a spatio‐temporal context
                  exacerbated differences between the data sources and resulted
                  in no greater ecological insight into change in the Gatekeeper
                  population. Our work provides a computationally feasible
                  framework for spatio‐temporally explicit integration of data
                  within SDMs and demonstrates both the potential benefits and
                  the challenges in applying this methodology to real ecological

                  biodiversity reduces disease prevalence, but with inconclusive
                  evidence. In contrast, the amplification effect hypothesis
                  suggests that higher vector diversity may result in greater
                  disease transmission by increasing and diversifying the
                  transmission pathways. The relationship between vector
                  diversity and pathogen transmission remains unclear and
                  requires further study. Chagas disease is a vector-borne
                  disease most prevalent in Brazil and transmitted by multiple
                  species of insect vectors of the subfamily Triatominae, yet
                  the drivers of spatial variation in its impact on human
                  populations remain unresolved. We tested whether triatomine
                  species richness, latitude, bioclimatic variables, human host
                  population density, and socioeconomic variables predict Chagas
                  disease mortality rates across over 5000 spatial grid cells
                  covering all of Brazil. Results show that species richness of
                  triatomine vectors is a good predictor of mortality rates
                  caused by Chagas disease, which supports the amplification
                  effect hypothesis. Vector richness and the impact of Chagas

                  in response to natural and anthropogenic pressures, it is
                  important now more than ever to include parasites to improve
                  our understanding of their role, now and in the future. A
                  large-scale biodiversity survey of the coastal marine
                  ecosystem of Otago, New Zealand, provided a unique opportunity
                  to assess what contribution parasitological studies can make
                  toward revealing trophic interactions between species when
                  creating food webs. Here, we created 4 increasingly complex
                  food web depictions of Otago and compared network properties
                  between them to assess changes with each addition of new types
                  of data (first excluding and then including parasite species).
                  We also assessed how parasites influence the functioning of
                  Otago’s food web by simulating extinction scenarios for each
                  web, estimating their robustness to biodiversity loss. The
                  inclusion of parasites altered food web structure, such as
                  decreasing connectance and increasing path length, modularity
                  and species clustering. In both extinction scenarios,
                  including parasites resulted in a lower robustness of the food
                  webs to biodiversity loss. Our results suggest that neglecting
                  parasite taxa in food web studies may lead to inappropriate
                  estimates of ecosystem structure and functioning and possibly
                  an overestimation of an ecosystem’s resilience to change.
                  Above all, we reveal the huge potential of parasitological
                  studies to advance our understanding of predator-prey

                  challenges, problems, potential biases and constraints as
                  sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories.
                  Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links)
                  within diversified ecological networks require adequate
                  sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we
                  still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological
                  interactions. While the complete inventory of interactions is
                  likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main
                  patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must
                  acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of
                  interactions among, say, A animal species and P plant species
                  (i.e. ) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, that
                  is life‐history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed
                  interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically ,
                  resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.
                  Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for
                  interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to
                  individuals and species sampling, thus extending
                  diversity‐monitoring approaches to the characterization of
                  complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to
                  species inventories, a sizable fraction of non‐observed
                  pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological
                  constraints that forbid their occurrence. Reasons for
                  forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and
                  temporal uncoupling, size mismatches and intrinsically low
                  probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential
                  interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the
                  completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus
                  needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so
                  that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the
                  unobserved links when addressing sampling effort. Recent
                  implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or
                  for individual‐based data can be combined with the assessment
                  of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative
                  importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic
                  estimate of interaction richness in a robustly sampled
                  assemblage and the maximum richness of interactions. This is
                  crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of
                  defaunation‐driven loss of key ecological interactions and the
                  services they provide and the analogous losses related to
                  interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic
                  homogenization. A lay summary is available for this article.},

                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal

                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  specialization in single species, little is known about how
                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in
                  antagonistically coevolving systems. Here, we develop and
                  analyse a general model of victim-enemy coevolution that
                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy
                  investment in infectivity. We also investigate the
                  epidemiological consequences of environmental variability and
                  show that enemy population density is maximized for
                  intermediate lengths of productive seasons, which corresponds
                  to situations where enemies can evolve higher infectivity than
                  victims can evolve defence. We discuss our results in the

                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species

                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small

                  the biological sciences. While there are reliable ways to
                  characterize specificity at individual and community levels,
                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for
                  species‐level (or population‐level) specificity, we recommend
                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are
                  available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite

                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  and emerging properties. Several measures exist to assess
                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of
                  how modular the network is) and different module compositions
                  (i.e. different groups of species forming said modules). More
                  importantly, as each optimization method uses a different
                  optimization criterion, there is a need to have an a
                  posteriori measure serving as an equivalent of a
                  goodness-of-fit. In this article, I propose such a measure of
                  modularity, which is simply defined as the ratio of
                  interactions established between members of the same modules
                  vs. members of different modules. I apply this measure to a
                  large dataset of 290 ecological networks representing
                  host-parasite (bipartite) and predator-prey (unipartite)
                  interactions, to show how the results are easy to interpret
                  and present especially to a broad audience not familiar with
                  modularity analyses, but still can reveal new features about

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the

                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional

                  predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging
                  ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why
                  species interact, as this will allow the development of
                  mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better
                  characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
                  existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that
                  the current conceptualization of species interaction networks
                  is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future
                  research must start to account for the intrinsic variability
                  of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex
                  networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
                  there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
                  properties related to the establishment of species
                  interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based
                  processes, we show that this new approach will improve our
                  predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how
                  species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
                  Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of
                  ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and
                  why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we
                  build on existing empirical literature to show that the same
                  species may happen to interact in different ways when their
                  local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or
                  when the environment affects either of these factors. We
                  discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing
                  frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species
                  interactions.},

                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured

                  ecology, including examples of facilitative interactions, such
                  as plant‐pollinator networks, and antagonistic interactions,
                  such as virus–host infection networks. Statistical network
                  analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom
                  patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns
                  on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring
                  patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is
                  a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting
                  subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the
                  interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an
                  open‐source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of
                  bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat
                  enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a
                  bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire
                  network) to local (i.e. module‐level) scales – and
                  meta‐analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In
                  common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which
                  a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical
                  significance of these patterns, and enables visualization of
                  latent structures in the network. BiMat is available as an

                  species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the

                  species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove
                  interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying
                  such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however,
                  remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of

                  that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In
                  particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death

                  extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types

                  interactions. Our results provide a common modelling framework
                  for the evolution of ecological networks that we anticipate
                  will contribute to the greater consideration of the explicit
                  role played by species interactions in models of

                  generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a
                  given community. Different techniques have been devised to
                  predict species interactions using theoretical models or
                  abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach,
                  with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a
                  supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are
                  algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict
                  whether a customer will like a product given the preferences
                  of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are
                  well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they
                  focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a
                  predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey
                  around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881
                  possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results
                  for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a
                  supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can
                  predict interactions with high accuracy using only three
                  traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions
                  can be predicted without regard to the ecological community
                  given only three variables: body mass and two variables for
                  the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as
                  recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of
                  traits, using only information about other species'
                  interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as
                  random forests base their predictions on traits only but do
                  not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should
                  focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for
                  ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to
                  capture indirect relationships between species.},

                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that

                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we

                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We

                  range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding
                  the influence of several driving processes, we know little as
                  to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual
                  molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence
                  of structures at larger scales, such as co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods
                  commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the
                  structure of community interaction matrices, so-called
                  bipartite networks, reflected observed co-evolutionary
                  dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not
                  have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a
                  consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one
                  previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race co-evolutionary
                  dynamics and the other fluctuating co-evolutionary dynamics.
                  Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary
                  time, but we found no evidence for a trade-off with impact on
                  bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage
                  showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence
                  that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular
                  changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor,
                  while bacteria co-evolving with the fluctuating selection
                  phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions
                  of the pilF gene associated with type IV pili. We conclude
                  that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is
                  not necessarily specific to co-evolutionary dynamics, and
                  discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was,
                  nevertheless, locally adapted.},

                  sparse matrices, are usually collected through observation
                  studies targeted at identifying species interactions. Due to
                  the extensive required sampling effort, species interaction
                  datasets usually contain many false negatives, often leading
                  to bias in derived descriptors. We show that a simple linear
                  filter can be used to detect false negatives by scoring
                  interactions based on the structure of the interaction
                  matrices. On 180 different datasets of various sizes,
                  sparsities and ecological interaction types, we found that on
                  average in about 75\% of the cases, a false negative
                  interaction got a higher score than a true negative
                  interaction. Furthermore, we show that this filter is very
                  robust, even when the interaction matrix contains a very large
                  number of false negatives. Our results demonstrate that
                  unobserved interactions can be detected in species interaction
                  datasets, even without resorting to information about the
                  species involved.},

                  and a slightly less common observation for parasite

                  adhere to a similar pattern of decreasing interaction
                  similarity with increasing geographic distance, especially if
                  species interactions are maintained across space. We extend

                  resulting in complete dissimilarity after approximately 2500
                  km. Our failure to detect a decay in network structural
                  similarity suggests the possibility that different host and
                  parasite species are filling the same functional roles in
                  interaction networks, or that variation in network similarity
                  may be better explained by other geographic variables or

                  implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing
                  journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely
                  requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that
                  they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience
                  is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research

  abstract     = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial
                  distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the
                  way species interact with one another, but only recently
                  community ecologists realized the need to document their
                  spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an
                  integrated approach, adopting the view that community
                  structure is best represented as a network of ecological
                  interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography
                  questions. We propose that the ecological niche should
                  encompass the effect of the environment on species
                  distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on
                  the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian
                  dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a
                  quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in
                  space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction
                  distribution modeling. We apply this framework to
                  host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two
                  aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation)
                  exert a strong imprint on species co‐occurrence, but not on
                  species interactions. Even where species co‐occur, interaction
                  proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to
                  variation in realized network structure. We also find that a
                  large majority of host‐parasite pairs are never found
                  together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their
                  probability to interact. This first attempt to explain
                  variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens
                  new perspectives at the interface of species distribution
                  modeling and community ecology.},

                  However, the accurate description of food webs requires
                  significant effort in time and resources, limiting their
                  widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods
                  allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy
                  variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently
                  described methods, as well as describe a composite model of
                  the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a
                  large, well‐described dataset. Both niche and neutral
                  processes are involved in determining whether or not two
                  species will form a feeding link in communities. Three
                  different models for determining niche constraints of feeding
                  interactions are compared, and all three models are extended
                  by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative
                  abundances. The three models compared here infer niche
                  processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local
                  species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a
                  composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all
                  three methods perform well at predicting individual species
                  interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up
                  to the network level, resulting in food web structure of
                  inferred networks being similar to their empirical
                  counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web
                  structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting
                  summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test
                  of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is
                  low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using
                  traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding
                  of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite
                  model of the two methods provides a framework for
                  investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait
                  distributions, and relative abundances, affect species
                  interactions, and network structure.},

                  shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic
                  structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is
                  contingent upon random chance, environmental filters and local
                  effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal
                  local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a
                  host–parasite system where species interactions vary
                  substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological
                  significance of individual interactions is maintained across
                  different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that
                  observed community variation at the local scale frequently
                  tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal.
                  When considered in terms of the interplay between community
                  ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate
                  that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to
                  show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even

  abstract     = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been
                  increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The
                  abstraction of ecological systems - such as communities -
                  through networks of interactions between their components
                  indeed provides a way to summarize this information with
                  single objects. The methodological framework derived from
                  graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to
                  analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on
                  established ecological theories as well as tools to address
                  new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test
                  ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand,
                  adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver
                  their full potential and account for their limitations. Here,
                  we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches
                  by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so
                  far, with - what we believe to be - their appropriate uses and
                  potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all
                  methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are
                  robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a
                  brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to
                  build them in order to summarize ecological information of
                  different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the
                  types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer
                  from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis
                  testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the
                  organization of species interactions in a community yields
                  different network structures (e.g., more or less dense,
                  modular or nested), how different measures can be used to
                  describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to
                  compare communities based on these differences in structures.
                  Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to
                  describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of
                  species based on their position in the network and the
                  organization of their interactions as well as associated new
                  methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we
                  describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological
                  developments to address novel ecological questions.},

                  differ between ecosystems, there is growing evidence of
                  multiple ways in which they also exhibit common topological
                  properties. To reconcile these contrasting observations, we
                  postulate the existence of a backbone of interactions
                  underlying all ecological networks—a common substructure
                  within every network comprised of species playing similar
                  ecological roles—and a periphery of species whose
                  idiosyncrasies help explain the differences between networks.
                  To test this conjecture, we introduce a new approach to
                  investigate the structural similarity of 411 food webs from
                  multiple environments and biomes. We first find significant
                  differences in the way species in different ecosystems
                  interact with each other. Despite these differences, we then
                  show that there is compelling evidence of a common backbone of
                  interactions underpinning all food webs. We expect that
                  identifying a backbone of interactions will shed light on the
                  rules driving assembly of different ecological communities.},

                  understanding ecosystems in ways unattainable by taxonomic
                  diversity studies. Underlying this promise is the intuition
                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions
                  should be clearly addressed, notably for the sake of an
                  effective comparison and integration across domains, and for
                  assessing whether or not to use functional diversity
                  approaches for developing ecological management strategies.
                  The objective of this contribution is to identify and
                  critically analyze the most salient of these assumptions. To
                  this aim, we provide an epistemic roadmap that pinpoints these

                  provide to humans are largely dependent on complex
                  interactions between prey and predators. These are embedded in
                  a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a
                  cascade of events following perturbations such as species
                  extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the
                  characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo
                  sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination
                  of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the
                  distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale
                  shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that
                  the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in

                  potential feeding links between co-occurring species-is highly
                  connected geographically with a low degree of spatial
                  modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea
                  surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In
                  contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have
                  greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to
                  species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems
                  are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations

                  understood through analyses of interaction networks. However,
                  these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases with
                  respect to both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and
                  interactions (the links between nodes), because the
                  detectability of species and their interactions is highly
                  heterogeneous. These ecological and statistical issues
                  directly affect ecologists' abilities to accurately construct
                  ecological networks. However, statistical biases introduced by
                  sampling are difficult to quantify in the absence of full
                  knowledge of the underlying ecological network's structure. To
                  explore properties of large-scale ecological networks, we
                  developed the software EcoNetGen, which constructs and samples
                  networks with predetermined topologies. These networks may
                  represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and
                  types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks
                  with different mathematical sampling designs that correspond
                  to methods used in field observations. The observed networks
                  generated by each sampling process were then analyzed with
                  respect to the number of components, size of components and
                  other network metrics. We show that the sampling effort needed
                  to estimate underlying network properties depends strongly
                  both on the sampling design and on the underlying network
                  topology. In particular, networks with random or scale-free
                  modules require more complete sampling to reveal their
                  structure, compared to networks whose modules are nested or
                  bipartite. Overall, modules with nested structure were the
                  easiest to detect, regardless of the sampling design used.
                  Sampling a network starting with any species that had a high
                  degree (e.g., abundant generalist species) was consistently
                  found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network
                  structure. Because high-degree species tend to be generalists,
                  abundant in natural communities relative to specialists, and
                  connected to each other, sampling by degree may therefore be
                  common but unintentional in empirical sampling of networks.
                  Conversely, sampling according to module (representing
                  different interaction types or taxa) results in a rather
                  complete view of certain modules, but fails to provide a
                  complete picture of the underlying network. To reduce biases
                  introduced by sampling methods, we recommend that these
                  findings be incorporated into field design considerations for
                  projects aiming to characterize large species interaction
                  networks.},

                  predict country-pathogen associations. We compare the success
                  rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence
                  and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number
                  of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g.
                  virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only
                  these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic
                  network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that
                  while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well
                  captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events
                  remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an
                  influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the
                  model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely
                  to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model
                  is able to use the information on the existing
                  country-pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly
                  well, suggesting the importance in considering information on
                  co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate
                  outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.},

                  planning for biodiversity maintenance. Yet methods to assess
                  connectivity are often limited, because simulating the
                  dispersal of many species is computationally prohibitive, and
                  current simulations make simplifying assumptions about
                  movement that are potentially erroneous. Here we show how
                  these limits can be circumvented and propose a novel framework
                  for the assessment of omnifunctional and omnidirectional
                  connectivity in a 28000 km2 area in the Laurentian region of
                  Québec, Canada. Our approach relies on (i) the use of
                  Omniscape, an improved version of Circuitscape which allows
                  omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal
                  movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of
                  species-level dispersal simulations through a posteriori
                  clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that
                  the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into
                  three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly
                  aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic
                  environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These
                  functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots,
                  suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for
                  the multiplicity of dispersal strategies. Although this
                  approach requires a large volume of computing resources, it
                  provides richer information on which landscape features are
                  critical to maintain or need to be regenerated for broader

                  food-chain analyses have focused on investigating the
                  consequences of these changes on ecosystem processes and the
                  resulting functions. These different and diverging conceptual
                  frameworks have each produced important results and identified
                  a set of important mechanisms, that shape ecosystem functions.
                  But the disconnection between these frameworks, and the
                  various simplifications of the study systems are not
                  representative of the complexity of real-world communities.
                  Here we use food webs as a more realistic depiction of
                  communities, and use a bioenergetic model to simulate their
                  biomass dynamics and quantify the resulting flows and stocks
                  of biomass. We use tools from food web analysis to investigate
                  how the predictions from BEF and food-chain analyses fit
                  together, how they correlate to food-web structure and how it
                  might help us understand the interplay between various drivers
                  of ecosystem functioning. We show that food web structure is
                  correlated to the community’s efficiency in storing the
                  captured biomass, which may explain the distribution of
                  biomass (top heaviness) across the different trophic
                  compartments (producers, primary and secondary consumers).
                  While we know that ecological network structure is important
                  in shaping ecosystem dynamics, identifying structural
                  attributes important in shaping ecosystem processes and
                  synthesizing how it affects various underpinning mechanisms
                  may help prioritize key conservation targets to protect not

                  elusive. Primarily, complexity has been defined on the basis
                  of the structural (or behavioural) complexity of the system.
                  These definitions ignore the notion of “physical complexity,”
                  which can measure the amount of information contained in an
                  ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress.
                  We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as
                  measures of “external” and “internal” complexity,
                  respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find
                  that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical
                  complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more
                  complex when compared to other types of interactions. In
                  addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural
                  measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral
                  radius), but does not inform about the resilience of a network
                  when using simulated extinction cascades, which has previously
                  been reported for structural measures of complexity. We argue
                  that SVD entropy provides a fundamentally more “correct”
                  measure of network complexity and should be added to the
                  toolkit of descriptors of ecological networks moving forward.}

  abstract     = {Networks of species interactions underpin numerous ecosystem
                  processes, but comprehensively sampling these interactions is
                  difficult. Interactions intrinsically vary across space and
                  time, and given the number of species that compose ecological
                  communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true
                  negative (where two species never interact) from a false
                  negative (where two species have not been observed interacting
                  even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of
                  interactions between species is an imperative for several
                  fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions
                  between species-and to describe the structure, variation, and
                  change of the ecological networks they form-we need to rely on
                  modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we
                  show how a simple neural network model makes accurate
                  predictions about species interactions given limited data. We
                  then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with
                  improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual
                  roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological
                  networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude
                  with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed
                  to start building these models, which we hope will guide this
                  research programme forward. This article is part of the theme

                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and

                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of

                  of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in
                  One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled
                  through both reconciliation of static data sets and
                  integration of dynamically updated databases. These data
                  sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone,
                  including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and

                  methodology and evidence strength are also available in a
                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an

                  that are spatially referenced for both uniformly or randomly

                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and

                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the
                  limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first
                  approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to

                  ecological processes alone as often assumed. Instead, much of
                  the totality of topological differences between
                  networks-topological heterogeneity-could be due to variations
                  in research designs and approaches that different researchers
                  use to create each species interaction network. To evaluate
                  the degree to which this topological heterogeneity is present
                  in available ecological networks, we first compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity across 723 species interaction
                  networks created by different sets of researchers with the
                  amount quantified from non-ecological networks known to be
                  constructed following more consistent approaches. Then, to
                  further test whether the topological heterogeneity was due to
                  differences in study designs, and not only to inherent
                  variation within ecological networks, we compared the amount
                  of topological heterogeneity between species interaction
                  networks created by the same sets of researchers (i.e.,
                  networks from the same publication) with the amount quantified
                  between networks that were each from a unique publication
                  source. We found that species interaction networks are highly
                  topologically heterogeneous: while species interaction
                  networks from the same publication are much more topologically
                  similar to each other than interaction networks that are from
                  a unique publication, they still show at least twice as much
                  heterogeneity as any category of non-ecological networks that
                  we tested. Altogether, our findings suggest that extra care is
                  necessary to effectively analyze species interaction networks
                  created by different researchers, perhaps by controlling for
                  the publication source of each network.},

                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

                  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

                  find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of

                  richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a

                  consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if
                  this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
                  singularly the most important factor for the functioning of
                  ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a
                  species to the local environment also play an essential role.
                  Understanding the relative importance of these factors is
                  crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will
                  have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more complete
                  understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is
                  necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as
                  the influences of species distribution and local adaptation,

                  structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem functioning. We
                  accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural
                  temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
                  common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the
                  importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of
                  each community was crossed with the temperature from each
                  site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic
                  regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the
                  mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found that
                  temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
                  origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with
                  temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of

                  examined how habitat loss influenced the diversity and
                  abundance of species from different trophic levels, with
                  different traits, by taking advantage of an inadvertent
                  experiment that created habitat islands from a once continuous
                  forest via the creation of the Thousand Island Lake, a large
                  reservoir in China. On 28 of these islands with more than a
                  9000‐fold difference in their area (0.12–1154 ha), we sampled
                  plants, herbivorous insects, and predatory insects using
                  effort‐controlled sampling and analyses. This allowed us to
                  discern whether any observed differences in species diversity
                  were due to passive sampling alone or to demographic effects
                  that disproportionately influenced some species relative to
                  others. We found that while most metrics of sampling
                  effort‐controlled diversity increased with island area, the
                  strength of the effect was exacerbated for species in higher
                  trophic levels. When we more explicitly examined differences
                  in species composition among islands, we found that the
                  pairwise difference in species composition among islands was
                  dominated by species turnover but that nestedness increased
                  with differences in island area, indicating that some species
                  are more likely to be absent from smaller islands.
                  Furthermore, by examining trends of several dispersal‐related
                  traits of species, we found that species with lower dispersal
                  propensity tended to be those that were lost from smaller
                  islands, which was observed for herbivorous and predatory
                  insects. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating
                  within‐patch demographic effects, as well as the taxa and
                  traits of species when understanding the influence of habitat
                  loss on biodiversity.},

                  aspects of the life of vertebrates and hence understanding how
                  it varies between species is crucial. Mammalian home range
                  size has been linked to body size and diet, but these studies
                  were based predominantly on terrestrial species and most
                  specifically excluded bats. As the only group of flying
                  mammals, bats experience distinctly different constraints on
                  movement, and hence home range. However, despite their
                  diversity, relatively little is known about the home ranges of
                  bats, and this is the first global review assessing correlates
                  of their home range size. Our hypothesis is that home range
                  will be impacted by different ecological conditions
                  experienced by the bats and by the biological traits of the
                  bats themselves. We performed a meta-analysis based on
                  published data for 81 bat species to identify variables that
                  contribute most to home range size. Sex, wing loading,
                  functional group, colony size, dietary class, distance from
                  the equator (latitudinal region), habitat type, and the
                  interaction between habitat type and latitudinal region were
                  all important explanatory variables. Wing loading was
                  positively correlated with home range size—while females,
                  open-air foragers, large colony sizes, and bats in temperate
                  regions consistently had large home ranges. Understanding the
                  correlates of home range has important implications, for
                  example, for bat conservation and for assessing the risk of
                  spillover of zoonotic pathogens from bats to humans and
                  livestock.},

                  Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate

                  climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease
                  and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively
                  quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show
                  significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis,
                  tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection,
                  cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related
                  to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven
                  results are consistent with previous reasoning-based
                  propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing
                  threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and
                  leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with
                  increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and

                  landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease
                  prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and

                  be seropositive decreased by 66\% (0.6 to 0.2) with an
                  increasing share of grey infrastructure (40 \% to 80 \%),
                  suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban
                  areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g. less foxes or
                  raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in
                  strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed
                  patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to
                  water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV
                  transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control
                  actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife
                  interactions should focus on such areas. The possible
                  underlying mechanisms may be increased isolation, the absence
                  of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing
                  the ability of CDV to persist without a host.},

                  momentum as a way to circumvent limitations in data volume.
                  Yet, ecological networks are challenging to predict because
                  they are typically small and sparse. Dealing with extreme
                  class imbalance is a challenge for most binary classifiers,
                  and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
                  models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple
                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In 2014, Western Africa experienced an
                  unanticipated explosion of Ebola virus infections. What
                  distinguishes fatal from non-fatal outcomes remains largely
                  unknown, yet is key to optimising personalised treatment
                  strategies. We used transcriptome data for peripheral blood
                  taken from infected and convalescent recovering patients to
                  identify early stage host factors that are associated with
                  acute illness and those that differentiate patient survival
                  from fatality. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that individuals
                  who succumbed to the disease show stronger upregulation of
                  interferon signalling and acute phase responses compared to
                  survivors during the acute phase of infection. Particularly
                  notable is the strong upregulation of albumin and fibrinogen
                  genes, which suggest significant liver pathology. Cell subtype
                  prediction using messenger RNA expression patterns indicated
                  that NK-cell populations increase in patients who survive
                  infection. By selecting genes whose expression properties
                  discriminated between fatal cases and survivors, we identify a
                  small panel of responding genes that act as strong predictors
                  of patient outcome, independent of viral load. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Transcriptomic analysis of the host response to pathogen
                  infection using blood samples taken during an outbreak
                  situation can provide multiple levels of information on both
                  disease state and mechanisms of pathogenesis. Host biomarkers
                  were identified that provide high predictive value under
                  conditions where other predictors, such as viral load, are
                  poor prognostic indicators. The data suggested that rapid
                  analysis of the host response to infection in an outbreak
                  situation can provide valuable information to guide an
                  understanding of disease outcome and mechanisms of disease.},

                  shaped locally by interactions between climatic and
                  socio-environmental factors is not well understood. Here, we
                  investigate the drivers of dengue incidence and emergence in
                  Vietnam, through analysing 23 years of district-level case
                  data spanning a period of significant socioeconomic change
                  (1998-2020). We show that urban infrastructure factors
                  (sanitation, water supply, long-term urban growth) predict
                  local spatial patterns of dengue incidence, while human
                  mobility is a more influential driver in subtropical northern
                  regions than the endemic south. Temperature is the dominant
                  factor shaping dengue's distribution and dynamics, and using
                  long-term reanalysis temperature data we show that warming
                  since 1950 has expanded transmission risk throughout Vietnam,
                  and most strongly in current dengue emergence hotspots (e.g.,
                  southern central regions, Ha Noi). In contrast, effects of
                  hydrometeorology are complex, multi-scalar and dependent on
                  local context: risk increases under either short-term
                  precipitation excess or long-term drought, but improvements in
                  water supply mitigate drought-associated risks except under
                  extreme conditions. Our findings challenge the assumption that
                  dengue is an urban disease, instead suggesting that incidence
                  peaks in transitional landscapes with intermediate
                  infrastructure provision, and provide evidence that
                  interactions between recent climate change and mobility are
                  contributing to dengue's expansion throughout Vietnam.},

                  habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely
                  recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic
                  disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk
                  are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains
                  unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might
                  cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic
                  composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic,
                  trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human
                  pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and
                  376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort,
                  and show that land use has global and systematic effects on
                  local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of
                  human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a
                  greater proportion of local species richness (18-72\% higher)
                  and total abundance (21-144\% higher) in sites under
                  substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban
                  ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The
                  magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest
                  for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species,
                  which may be one factor that underpins the global importance
                  of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that
                  mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either
                  human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in
                  human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be
                  mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence
                  both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our
                  results suggest that global changes in the mode and the
                  intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous
                  interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs

                  socioeconomic, environmental and ecological factors1. Studies
                  have shown that infectious disease risk is modified by changes

                  pollution12-14, landscape transformations15-20 and species

                  change drivers most increase disease and under what contexts.
                  Here we amassed a dataset from the literature that contains
                  2,938 observations of infectious disease responses to global
                  change drivers across 1,497 host-parasite combinations,

                  disease-related end points or harm, whereas urbanization is

                  and non-human diseases. Nevertheless, context-dependent

                  becomes: How can science most rapidly progress to address
                  large, complex global problems? We suggest that the lag in the
                  development of a more predictive science of the biosphere is
                  not only because the biosphere is so much more complex, or
                  because we do not have enough data, or are not doing enough
                  experiments, but, in large part, because of unresolved tension
                  between the three dominant scientific cultures that pervade
                  the research community. We introduce and explain the concept
                  of the three scientific cultures and present a novel analysis
                  of their characteristics, supported by examples and a formal
                  mathematical definition/representation of what this means and
                  implies. The three cultures operate, to varying degrees,
                  across all of science. However, within the biosciences, and in
                  contrast to some of the other sciences, they remain relatively
                  more separated, and their lack of integration has hindered
                  their potential power and insight. Our solution to
                  accelerating a broader, predictive science of the biosphere is
                  to enhance integration of scientific cultures. The process of
                  integration—Scientific Transculturalism—recognizes that the
                  push for interdisciplinary research, in general, is just not
                  enough. Unless these cultures of science are formally
                  appreciated and their thinking iteratively integrated into
                  scientific discovery and advancement, there will continue to
                  be numerous significant challenges that will increasingly
                  limit forecasting and prediction efforts.},

                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt

                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species

                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more

                  to greenhouse gas emissions and will continue to change over
                  this century, accelerating without effective global efforts to
                  reduce emissions. Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are
                  inherently climate-sensitive due to the sensitivity of tick
                  lifecycles to climate. Key direct climate and weather
                  sensitivities include survival of individual ticks, and the
                  duration of development and host-seeking activity of ticks.
                  These sensitivities mean that in some regions a warming
                  climate may increase tick survival, shorten life-cycles and
                  lengthen the duration of tick activity seasons. Indirect
                  effects of climate change on host communities may, with
                  changes in tick abundance, facilitate enhanced transmission of
                  tick-borne pathogens. High temperatures, and extreme weather
                  events (heat, cold, and flooding) are anticipated with climate
                  change, and these may reduce tick survival and pathogen
                  transmission in some locations. Studies of the possible
                  effects of climate change on TTBDs to date generally project
                  poleward range expansion of geographical ranges (with possible
                  contraction of ranges away from the increasingly hot tropics),
                  upslope elevational range spread in mountainous regions, and
                  increased abundance of ticks in many current endemic regions.
                  However, relatively few studies, using long-term

                  climate change. Further integrated 'One Health' observational
                  and modeling studies are needed to detect changes in TTBD
                  occurrence, attribute them to climate change, and to develop
                  predictive models of public- and animal-health needs to plan

                  conceived to study, report, and manage biodiversity change.
                  The EBV netCDF structure was developed in order to support
                  publication and interoperability of biodiversity data. This
                  standard is based on the Network Common Data Format (netCDF).
                  Additionally, it follows the Climate and Forecast Conventions
                  (CF, version 1.8) and the Attribute Convention for Data
                  Discovery (ACDD, version 1.3). The standard allows several
                  datacubes per netCDF file (see Fig. 1). These cubes have four
                  dimensions: longitude, latitude, time and entity, whereby the
                  last dimension can, for example, encompass different species
                  or groups of species, ecosystem types or other aspects. The
                  usage of hierarchical groups enables the coexistence of
                  multiple EBV cubes (see Fig. 2). The first level (netCDF
                  group) are scenarios, e.g., the modelling for different Shared
                  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. The second level
                  (netCDF group) are metrics, e.g., the percentage of protected
                  area per pixel and its proportional loss over a certain time
                  span per pixel. All metrics are repeated per scenario, if any
                  are present. The result is a rather complex raster dataset
                  (see example dataset in Fig. 3). This is where the ebvcube R
                  package comes into play. This R package enables scientists to
                  create their own netCDFs in the EBV cube standard. Its
                  functionality covers the creation, opening/reading and
                  visualizing the EBV netCDFs. The ebvcube package is part of
                  the overall EBV infrastructure and works together with the EBV
                  Data Portal. Users can work with the downloaded EBV netCDFs or
                  upload their own EBV netCDFs to the portal. Generally, the
                  package aims to condense the output for the users and assist
                  in the understanding of the file structure to overcome the
                  complexity. The output is reduced to the necessary
                  information, e.g., not displaying coordinate variables or any
                  technical attributes. Moreover, functionality for a quick data
                  exploration is implemented.},

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response

                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to

                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some

                  interactions capture some degree of variation that is not
                  apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this

                  different ways as a response to different environmental
                  factors, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss
                  the implications of this finding for the amount of information

                  driver of biological diversity. However, the tempo and mode of
                  phenotypic evolution in deep-time has been predominantly
                  investigated using trait evolutionary models which assume that
                  lineages evolve independently from each other. Consequently,
                  the role of species interactions in driving macroevolutionary
                  dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify the
                  prevalence for signatures of competition between related
                  species in the evolution of ecomorphological traits across the
                  bird radiation. We find that mechanistic trait models
                  accounting for the effect of species interactions on
                  phenotypic divergence provide the best fit for the data on at
                  least one trait axis in 27 out of 59 clades ranging between 21
                  and 195 species. Where it occurs, the signature of competition
                  generally coincides with positive species

                  with similar ecologies, and we find scarce evidence for

                  interspecific competition is often eroded in long-term
                  patterns of phenotypic diversification, and that other
                  selection pressures may predominantly shape ecomorphological

  abstract     = {Species loss within a microbial community can increase
                  resource availability and spur adaptive evolution.
                  Environmental shifts that cause species loss or fluctuations
                  in community composition are expected to become more common,
                  so it is important to understand the evolutionary forces that
                  shape the stability and function of the emergent community.
                  Here we study experimental cultures of a simple, ecologically
                  stable community of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus
                  plantarum, in order to understand how the presence or absence
                  of a species impacts coexistence over evolutionary timescales.
                  We found that evolution in coculture led to drastically
                  altered evolutionary outcomes for L. plantarum, but not S.
                  cerevisiae. Both monoculture- and co-culture-evolved L.
                  plantarum evolved dozens of mutations over 925 generations of
                  evolution, but only L. plantarum that had evolved in isolation
                  from S. cerevisiae lost the capacity to coexist with S.
                  cerevisiae. We find that the evolutionary loss of ecological
                  stability corresponds with fitness differences between
                  monoculture-evolved L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae and genetic
                  changes that repeatedly evolve across the replicate
                  populations of L. plantarum. This work shows how coevolution
                  within a community can prevent destabilising evolution in
                  individual species, thereby preserving ecological diversity
                  and stability, despite rapid adaptation.},

                  been an active and inspiring area of evolutionary research for
                  nearly 60 years. Perhaps owing to its great natural history
                  and potential consequences spanning population divergence to
                  species diversification, coevolution continues to capture the
                  imagination of biologists. Here we trace developments
                  following Ehrlich and Raven's classic paper, with a particular
                  focus on the modern influence of two studies by Dr. May
                  Berenbaum in the 1980s. This series of classic work presented
                  a compelling example exhibiting the macroevolutionary patterns
                  predicted by Ehrlich and Raven and also formalized a
                  microevolutionary approach to measuring selection, functional
                  traits, and understanding reciprocal adaptation between plants
                  and their herbivores. Following this breakthrough was a wave
                  of research focusing on diversifying macroevolutionary
                  patterns, mechanistic chemical ecology, and natural selection
                  on populations within and across community types. Accordingly,
                  we breakdown coevolutionary theory into specific hypotheses at
                  different scales: reciprocal adaptation between populations
                  within a community, differential coevolution among
                  communities, lineage divergence, and phylogenetic patterns. We
                  highlight progress as well as persistent gaps, especially the
                  link between reciprocal adaptation and diversification.},

                  proposed in 2013 to improve harmonization of biodiversity data
                  into meaningful metrics. EBVs were conceived as a small set of
                  variables which collectively capture biodiversity change at
                  multiple spatial scales and within time intervals that are of
                  scientific and management interest. Despite the apparent
                  simplicity of the concept, a plethora of variables that
                  describes not only biodiversity but also any environmental
                  features have been proposed as potential EBV (i.e. candidate
                  EBV). The proliferation of candidates reflects a lack of
                  clarity on what may constitute a variable that is essential to
                  track biodiversity change, which hampers the
                  operationalization of EBVs and therefore needs to be urgently
                  addressed. Here, we propose that an EBV should be defined as a
                  biological state variable in three key dimensions (time,
                  space, and biological organization) that is critical to

                  efforts to gather two centuries of biodiversity inventories

                  shortfalls and review the tradeoffs between generality and
                  uncertainty. We present seven key shortfalls of current
                  biodiversity data. Four previously proposed shortfalls
                  pinpoint knowledge gaps for species taxonomy (Linnean),
                  distribution (Wallacean), abundance (Prestonian), and
                  evolutionary patterns (Darwinian). We also redefine the
                  Hutchinsonian shortfall to apply to the abiotic tolerances of
                  species and propose new shortfalls relating to limited
                  knowledge of species traits (Raunkiæran) and biotic
                  interactions (Eltonian). We conclude with a general framework

                  large-scale biodiversity knowledge for evolutionary and

                  Although some theories describe the imprint that interactions
                  will have over long timescales, we are still missing a
                  comprehensive understanding of the effects of interactions on
                  macroevolution. Current research shows strong evidence for the
                  impact of interactions on macroevolutionary patterns of trait
                  evolution and diversification, yet many macroevolutionary
                  studies have only a tenuous relationship to ecological studies
                  of interactions over shorter timescales. We review current

                  communities and power grids may be viewed as networks of
                  connected elements. Such systems can go through critical
                  transitions driven by an avalanche of contagious change. Here
                  we ask, where in a complex network such a systemic shift is
                  most likely to start. Intuitively, a central node seems the
                  most likely source of such change. Indeed, topological studies
                  suggest that central nodes can be the Achilles heel for
                  attacks. We argue that the opposite is true for the class of
                  networks in which all nodes tend to follow the state of their
                  neighbors, a category we call two-way pull networks. In this
                  case, a well-connected central node is an unlikely starting
                  point of a systemic shift due to the buffering effect of
                  connected neighbors. As a result, change is most likely to
                  cascade through the network if it spreads first among
                  relatively poorly connected nodes in the periphery. The
                  probability of such initial spread is highest when the
                  perturbation starts from intermediately connected nodes at the
                  periphery, or more specifically, nodes with intermediate
                  degree and relatively low closeness centrality. Our finding is
                  consistent with empirical observations on social innovation,
                  and may be relevant to topics as different as the sources of
                  originality of art, collapse of financial and ecological

                  nasopharyngeal swabs approximately monthly for multiplex viral
                  diagnostics. Throughout the course of the study, we also
                  collected 445 faecal samples from 55 wild chimpanzees living
                  nearby in Kibale in social groups that have experienced
                  repeated, and sometimes lethal, epidemics of human-origin
                  respiratory viral disease. We characterized respiratory
                  pathogens in each cohort and examined statistical associations
                  between PCR positivity for detected pathogens and potential
                  risk factors. Children exhibited high incidence rates of
                  respiratory infections, whereas incidence rates in adults were
                  far lower. COVID-19 lockdown in 2020–2021 significantly
                  decreased respiratory disease incidence in both people and
                  chimpanzees. Human respiratory infections peaked in June and
                  September, corresponding to when children returned to school.
                  Rhinovirus, which caused a 2013 outbreak that killed 10\% of
                  chimpanzees in a Kibale community, was the most prevalent
                  human pathogen throughout the study and the only pathogen
                  present at each monthly sampling, even during COVID-19
                  lockdown. Rhinovirus was also most likely to be carried
                  asymptomatically by adults. Although we did not detect human
                  respiratory pathogens in the chimpanzees during the cohort
                  study, we detected human metapneumovirus in two chimpanzees
                  from a February 2023 outbreak that were genetically similar to
                  viruses detected in study participants in 2019. Our data
                  suggest that respiratory pathogens circulate in children and
                  that adults become asymptomatically infected during
                  high-transmission times of year. These asymptomatic adults may
                  then unknowingly carry the pathogens into forest and infect
                  chimpanzees. This conclusion, in turn, implies that
                  intervention strategies based on respiratory symptoms in
                  adults are unlikely to be effective for reducing reverse
                  zoonotic transmission of respiratory viruses to chimpanzees.},

                  is far greater than in low- and middle-income countries
                  (LMICs). As a result, there continue to be high rates of

                  homogenization in urbanized landscapes, there are increasing
                  efforts to conserve and increase biodiversity within urban
                  areas. Accordingly, around the world, previously extirpated
                  species are (re)colonizing and otherwise infiltrating urban
                  landscapes, while other species are disappearing from these
                  landscapes. Tracking the occurrence of traditionally urban
                  intolerant species and loss of traditionally urban tolerant
                  species should be a management goal of urban areas, but we
                  generally lack tools to study this phenomenon. To address this
                  gap, we first used species’ occurrences from iNaturalist, a
                  large collaborative dataset of species observations, to
                  calculate an urban association index (UAI) for 967 native
                  animal species that occur in the city of Los Angeles. On
                  average, the occurrence of native species was negatively
                  associated with our composite measure of urban intensity, with
                  the exception of snails and slugs, which instead occur more
                  frequently in areas of increased urban intensity. Next, we
                  assessed 8,348 0.25 x 0.25 mile grids across the City of Los
                  Angeles to determine the average grid-level UAI scores (i.e.,
                  a summary of the UAIs present in a grid cell, which we term
                  Community Urban Tolerance Index or CUTI). We found that areas
                  of higher urban intensity host more urban tolerant species,
                  but also that taxonomic groups differ in their aggregate
                  tolerance of urban areas, and that spatial patterns of
                  tolerance vary between groups. The framework established here
                  has been designed to be iteratively reevaluated by city
                  managers of Los Angeles in order to track the progress of
                  initiatives to preserve and encourage urban biodiversity, but
                  can be rescaled to sample different regions within the city or
                  different cities altogether to provide a valuable tool for

                  evolutionary processes to modern biodiversity patterns. Yet
                  inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species
                  involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility
                  to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary
                  timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of
                  mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture
                  root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our
                  "backbone-and-patch" approach to tree building applies a newly
                  assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian
                  inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major
                  lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2)
                  species-level "patch" phylogenies with nonoverlapping
                  in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage
                  in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded
                  ("DNA-only" trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints
                  using branch lengths drawn from local birth-death models
                  ("completed" trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones
                  results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all
                  branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby
                  facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as
                  marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees
                  to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence
                  times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among
                  studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are
                  estimated more accurately in our study than in previous
                  "supertree" approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to
                  branch-length artifacts. Credible sets of mammalian

                  widespread popularity in recent years. As BART becomes more
                  mainstream, there is an increased need for a paper that walks
                  readers through the details of BART, from what it is to why it

                  addition to explaining the different components of BART using
                  simple examples, we also discuss a framework, the General BART
                  model that unifies some of the recent BART extensions,
                  including semiparametric models, correlated outcomes, and
                  statistical matching problems in surveys, and models with
                  weaker distributional assumptions. By showing how these models

                  Value-Free Ideal in conservation science: the view that
                  measurements and metrics are value-free epistemic tools
                  detached from ideological, ethical, social, and, generally,
                  non-epistemic considerations. Contrary to this view, I will
                  argue that traditional measurement practices entrenched in
                  conservation are in fact permeated with non-epistemic values.
                  I challenge the received view by revealing three non-epistemic
                  assumptions underlying traditional metrics: (1) a
                  human-environment demarcation, (2) the desirability of a
                  people-free landscape, and (3) the exclusion of cultural
                  diversity from biodiversity. I also draw a connection between
                  arguments for retaining traditional metrics to “scientific
                  colonialism,” exemplified by a fortress conservation model. I
                  conclude by advocating for abandoning the myth of the
                  intrinsic value-freedom of measurement practices and embracing
                  metrics aligned with societal and scientific goals.},

                  although substantial effort has been made to reconcile
                  microevolution and macroevolution, much work remains to
                  identify the links between biological processes at play. We
                  highlight four major questions of evolutionary biology whose
                  solutions require conceptual bridges between micro and
                  macroevolution. We review potential avenues for future
                  research to establish how mechanisms at one scale (drift,
                  mutation, migration, selection) translate to processes at the
                  other scale (speciation, extinction, biogeographic dispersal)
                  and vice versa. We propose ways in which current comparative
                  methods to infer molecular evolution, phenotypic evolution and
                  species diversification could be improved to specifically
                  address these questions. We conclude that researchers are in a

  abstract = {All poetic forms come from somewhere. Prosodic templates can be
              copied for generations, altered by individuals, imported from
              foreign traditions, or fundamentally changed under the pressures
              of language evolution. Yet these relationships are notoriously
              difficult to trace across languages and times. This paper
              introduces an unsupervised method for detecting structural
              similarities in poems using local sequence alignment. The method
              relies on encoding poetic texts as strings of prosodic features
              using a four-letter alphabet; these sequences are then aligned to
              derive a distance measure based on weighted symbol (mis)matches.
              Local alignment allows poems to be clustered according to emergent
              properties of their underlying prosodic patterns. We evaluate
              method performance on a meter recognition tasks against strong
              baselines and show its potential for cross-lingual and historical
              research using three short case studies: 1) mutations in
              quantitative meter in classical Latin, 2) European diffusion of
              the Renaissance hendecasyllable, and 3) comparative alignment of
              modern meters in 18--19th century Czech, German and Russian. We

                  compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set
                  available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing
                  climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major
                  parasite clades. On the basis of 53,133 occurrences capturing
                  the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative
                  model projections suggest that 5 to 10\% of these species are
                  committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat
                  loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic

                  endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions,

                  indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates,
                  parasite richness could still increase by an order of
                  magnitude in some places, because species successfully
                  tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and
                  replace native species with unpredictable ecological

                  flowers. Zygomorphic flowers facilitate more precise contact
                  with pollinators, guide pollinator behaviour and exclude less
                  effective pollinators. However, whether zygomorphic flowers
                  are actually visited by a smaller subset of available
                  pollinator species has not been broadly evaluated. We compiled
                  53 609 floral visitation records in 159 communities and
                  classified the plants' floral symmetry. Globally and within
                  individual communities, plants with zygomorphic flowers are
                  indeed visited by fewer species. At the same time, zygomorphic
                  flowers share a somewhat larger proportion of their visitor
                  species with other co-occurring plants and have particularly
                  high sharing with co-occurring plants that also have

                  distances are incongruent with the phylogeny of replicase

                  visualize, compare, download, and upload trait data across the
                  animal tree of life—ExploreTrait, FeedTrait, and GetTrait. By
                  using ExploreTrait and GetTrait, users can explore, compare,
                  and extract 3954 trait records from 23,394 species centralized
                  in the Open Traits Network, and trait data for ~2000 species
                  from the AnimalTraits database. The app summarizes trait
                  information for numerous taxonomic groups within the Animal
                  Kingdom, encompassing data from diverse aquatic and
                  terrestrial ecosystems and various geographic regions
                  worldwide. Moreover, ZooTraits enables researchers to upload
                  trait information, serving as a hub for a continually
                  expanding global trait database. By promoting the
                  centralization of trait datasets and offering a platform for
                  data sharing, ZooTraits is facilitating advancements in
                  trait‐based ecological and evolutionary studies. We hope that
                  other trait databases will evolve to mirror the approach we

                  underlying biodiversity response to, or effects on, the
                  environment. Nevertheless, the Raunkiæran shortfall—the dearth
                  of knowledge on species traits and their
                  functionality—presents a challenge in the application of these
                  approaches. We conducted a systematic review to investigate
                  the trends and gaps in trait‐based animal ecology in terms of
                  taxonomic resolution, trait selection, ecosystem type, and
                  geographical region. In addition, we suggest a set of crucial
                  steps to guide trait selection and aid future research to
                  conduct within and cross‐taxon comparisons. We identified 1655
                  articles using virtually all animal groups published from 1999
                  to 2020. Studies were concentrated in vertebrates, terrestrial
                  habitats, the Palearctic realm, and mostly investigated
                  trophic and habitat dimensions. Additionally, they focused on
                  response traits (79.4\%) and largely ignored intraspecific
                  variation (94.6\%). Almost 36\% of the data sets did not
                  provide the rationale behind the selection of morphological
                  traits. The main limitations of trait‐based animal ecology
                  were the use of trait averages and a rare inclusion of
                  intraspecific variability. Nearly one‐fifth of the studies
                  based only on response traits conclude that trait diversity
                  impacts ecosystem processes or services without justifying the
                  connection between them or measuring them. We propose a guide
                  for standardizing trait collection that includes the
                  following: (i) determining the type of trait and the mechanism
                  linking the trait to the environment, ecosystem, or the
                  correlation between the environment, trait, and ecosystem,
                  (ii) using a “periodic table of niches” to select the
                  appropriate niche dimension to support a mechanistic trait
                  selection, and (iii) selecting the relevant traits for each
                  retained niche dimension. By addressing these gaps,
                  trait‐based animal ecology can become more predictive. This
                  implies that future research will likely focus on
                  collaborating to understand how environmental changes impact
                  animals and their capacity to provide ecosystem services and
                  goods.},

                  This system is characterised by the proliferation of journals
                  and publishers—unaffiliated with learned societies or

                  margins diverting funds away from the academic community.
                  Early career researchers (ECRs) are particularly vulnerable to
                  the consequences of this publishing system because of
                  intersecting factors, including pressure to pursue high impact
                  publications, rising publication costs and job insecurity.
                  Moving towards a more ethical system requires that scientists
                  advocate for structural change by making career choices that
                  come with risks, many of which disproportionately impact ECRs.

                  challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing
                  biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential
                  Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure
                  biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and
                  standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to
                  capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study,
                  report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the
                  challenges of a 'Big Data' approach to building global EBV
                  data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing
                  on species distribution and abundance. The majority of
                  currently available data on species distributions derives from
                  incidentally reported observations or from surveys where
                  presence-only or presence-absence data are sampled repeatedly
                  with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from
                  opportunistic population counts or from population time series
                  using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the
                  same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous
                  complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous,
                  multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different
                  sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV
                  data products requires correcting biases introduced by
                  imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with
                  different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing
                  measurement units from different data sources or sampling
                  methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial
                  inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of
                  uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the
                  development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations
                  Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key
                  workflow steps that will operationalize the process of
                  building EBV data products within and across research
                  infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple
                  sequential activities into account, including identification
                  and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality
                  control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of
                  integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete
                  examples from existing citizen science and professional
                  monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology
                  Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and
                  the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow
                  steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems
                  and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales.
                  They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we
                  provide an overview of current data and metadata standards.
                  Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV
                  data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining
                  heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in
                  geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating
                  emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as
                  citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and
                  satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues
                  related to data product structure, data storage, execution of
                  workflows and the production process/cycle as well as
                  approaching technical interoperability among research
                  infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by
                  developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing
                  consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal
                  interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free
                  from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing
                  these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for
                  assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and
                  sustainable development goals.},

                  there have been few efforts to identify and systematize One

                  emphasis on the evaluation of One Health has increased, widely
                  cited benefits of One Health approaches have mainly been based
                  on modeled projections, rather than outcomes of implemented
                  interventions. We conducted a review of One Health literature

                  case studies reporting One Health metrics. Of 1839 unique

                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with

                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and

                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets
                  for conservation purposes in unsampled locations.},

               is currently limited given the complexity of acquiring repeated
               spatial data for species interactions. Yet, recent developments
               of metawebs highlight efficient ways to first document possible
               interactions within regional species pools. Downscaling metawebs
               towards local network predictions is a promising approach to use
               current data to investigate the variation of networks across
               space. However, issues remain in how to represent the spatial
               variability and uncertainty of species interactions, especially
               for large-scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic
               framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian mammal
               metaweb and species occurrences from global databases. We
               investigated how our approach can be used to represent the
               variability of networks and communities between ecoregions in
               Canada. Species richness and interactions followed a similar
               latitudinal gradient across ecoregions but simultaneously
               identified contrasting diversity hotspots. Network motifs
               revealed additional areas of variation in network structure
               compared to species richness and number of links. Our method
               offers the potential to bring global predictions down to a more
               actionable local scale, and increases the diversity of ecological

                  two key strategies: constructing expansive datasets across 26
                  viral families and developing new models leveraging large
                  language models pre-trained on extensive nucleotide sequences.
                  Our approaches substantially boosted our model performance.
                  This enhancement was particularly notable in segmented RNA
                  viruses, which are involved with severe zoonoses but have been
                  overlooked due to limited data availability. Furthermore,

                  creating an artificial neural network model that learns from
                  spike protein sequences of alpha and beta coronaviruses and
                  their binding annotation to their host receptor. The proposed
                  method produces a human-Binding Potential (h-BiP) score that
                  distinguishes, with high accuracy, the binding potential among
                  coronaviruses. Three viruses, previously unknown to bind human

                  States is reinventing colonialism in the Global South through
                  the domination of digital technology. Using South Africa as a
                  case study, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial
                  control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem:
                  software, hardware and network connectivity, which then gives
                  rise to related forms of domination. The monopoly power of
                  multinational corporations is used for resource extraction
                  through rent and surveillance – economic domination. By
                  controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations
                  control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct
                  power over political, economic and cultural domains of life –
                  imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism,
                  Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates
                  economic power in the hands of US corporations – a system of
                  global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance
                  capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with
                  their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted
                  surveillance in the Global South – which intensifies imperial
                  state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that
                  society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions
                  of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech
                  hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that
                  decentralises technology by placing control directly into the
                  hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier
                  of digital empire.},

                  and biotic factors influenced by wetland management. Results
                  Of the 12 mosquito species identified, Culiseta annulata

                  Corixidae (water boatmen) and Zygoptera (Damselfy) larvae.
                  Models reveal that tier 3 management sites (higher winter
                  water levels, lower agricultural intensity) associated with
                  shade and less floating vegetation are preferred by specific
                  mosquito species. All mosquito species except Anopheles
                  maculipennis s.l., are negatively impacted by potential
                  predators. Culiseta annulata shows positive associations with
                  shaded and turbid water, contrary to preferences of Corixidae
                  predators. Conclusions Tier 3 areas managed for biodiversity,
                  characterised by higher seasonal water levels and reduced
                  livestock grazing intensity, provide favourable habitats for
                  key mosquito species that are known vectors of arboviruses,
                  such as Usutu and West Nile. Our findings emphasise the impact
                  of biodiversity-focused wetland management, altering mosquito
                  breeding site vegetation to enhance vector suitability.
                  Further exploration of these trade-offs is crucial for
                  comprehending the broader implications of wetland management.},

                  is much worse than those which have been observed in human
                  history, whether engineered or natural, has been the focus of
                  significant concern in biosecurity. Fundamental dynamics of
                  disease spread make such outbreaks much less likely than they
                  first appear. Here we present a slightly modified formulation
                  of the typical SEIR model that illustrates these dynamics more
                  clearly, and shows the unlikely cases where concern may still
                  be warranted. This is then applied to an extreme version of
                  proposed pandemic risk, multi-disease syndemics, to show that
                  (absent much clearer reasons for concern) the suggested
                  dangers are overstated.The models used in this paper are

                  contexts. We amassed a dataset from the literature that

                  global change drivers across 1,202 host-parasite combinations.
                  We found that biodiversity loss, climate change, and
                  introduced species were associated with increases in
                  disease-related endpoints or harm (i.e., enemy release for

                  decreases in disease endpoints. Natural biodiversity
                  gradients, deforestation, forest fragmentation, and most
                  classes of chemical contaminants had non-significant effects

                  national and regional laws and regulations, which mostly
                  result from the implementation of the United Nations’

                  with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. At
                  the local scale, we could observe that the composition of most
                  species assemblages changed according to temperature
                  variations. However, this change in composition always
                  occurred with a lag compared to climate change, suggesting
                  that communities are experiencing a climatic debt. Results
                  suggest that anthropization may play a role in the decoupling
                  between the change in CTI and the change in local temperature.
                  The results of our study highlight an overall
                  thermophilization of assemblages as a response of temperature
                  warming. We demonstrated that this response may exist for a
                  large range of understudied terrestrial animals, and we
                  introduced a framework that can be used in a broader context,
                  opening new opportunities for global change research.},

                  interest and central to policy efforts aimed at meeting
                  biodiversity targets. Changes in species diversity and high
                  rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide.
                  In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these
                  trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A
                  formal framework and guidelines for the detection and
                  attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an
                  inferential framework to guide detection and attribution
                  analyses, which identifies five steps-causal modelling,
                  observation, estimation, detection and attribution-for robust
                  attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity
                  change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple
                  potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from
                  contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible
                  statement of confidence about the role of drivers after robust
                  methods for trend detection and attribution have been
                  deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data
                  and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best
                  practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate
                  these steps with examples. This framework could strengthen the
                  bridge between biodiversity science and policy and support
                  effective actions to halt biodiversity loss and the impacts
                  this has on ecosystems. This article is part of the theme

                  voucher specimens verified by taxonomic experts comprised our

                  and its associated network. A survey approach was used to
                  identify existing capacities and resources within the network.
                  Most of GBIF Nodes survey respondents (80\%) are engaged in
                  onsite training activities, with a focus on work-based

                  Training topics include data mobilisation, digitisation,
                  management, publishing, analysis and use, to enable the
                  accessibility of analogue and digital biological data that

                  So far, however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused

                  elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity
                  generates services to humanity. This monitoring gap can be

                  However, there is no systematic sustained program for

  abstract     = {A fundamental problem associated with the task of network
                  reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in
                  determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner
                  that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network
                  with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status
                  quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization
                  combined with cross-validation. As we demonstrate, besides its
                  high computational cost, this commonplace approach
                  unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight
                  "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the
                  bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which
                  often results in substantial overfitting even after
                  cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative
                  nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical
                  Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not
                  rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach
                  follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and
                  uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most
                  compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without
                  requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our
                  approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a
                  single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a
                  principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used
                  with a large variety of generative models, without requiring
                  the number of edges to be known in advance. We also
                  demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased
                  accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and
                  empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with
                  the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial
                  communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in
                  the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how
                  the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of
                  interventions in the system.},

                  estuaries on the Pacific coast of California and Baja

                  particularly high, being comparable to that of the abundant
                  birds, fishes, burrowing shrimps and polychaetes. Trophically
                  transmitted parasites and parasitic castrators subsumed more

                  in Puget Sound, United States, and, if so, why. We performed
                  parasitological dissection of fluid-preserved specimens held
                  in natural history collections for eight fish species
                  collected between 1880 and 2019. We found that parasite taxa
                  using three or more obligately required host species-a group
                  that comprised 52\% of the parasite taxa we detected-declined
                  in abundance at a rate of 10.9\% per decade, whereas no change

                  mechanisms for the decline in 3+-host parasites and found that
                  parasite abundance was negatively correlated with sea surface
                  temperature, diminishing at a rate of 38\% for every 1 °C

                  since the 1990s. The authors focus on the principle of
                  transparency as a self-proclaimed basis of neoliberal
                  environmental governance, and on the role of standardized
                  science-based measurements which it purportedly affords. The
                  authors introduce the term ‘measurementality’ to signify the
                  governance logic that emerges when transparency comes to stand
                  next to effectiveness and efficiency as neoliberal principles
                  and to highlight the connections that are forged between
                  economic, managerial, and technocratic discourses. The example
                  of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
                  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is used to discuss
                  the role of measurementality in global biodiversity
                  governance. The analysis suggests that IPBES aims to
                  coordinate the science–policy interface in order to optimize
                  the generation of user-friendly knowledge of those elements of
                  biodiversity that are considered politically and economically
                  relevant: At the current economic juncture, these being in
                  essence ecosystem services. Based on these findings, the
                  authors proceed by critically reflecting on the ways in which
                  the measurementality logic of IPBES may not only result in an
                  impoverishment of the biodiversity research agenda, but also
                  in an impoverished understanding of biodiversity itself. To
                  conclude, the authors argue that measurementality is part and
                  parcel of the neoliberal paradigm in which science produces
                  the raw materials for subsequent control and exchange and
                  that, as a result, the intersection of science, discourse,
                  policy, and economics within these governance systems requires

                  species in a food web is likely to depend on the presence
                  and/or densities of other species in the community. How these
                  trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one
                  another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but
                  under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of
                  TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude
                  of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers,
                  and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each
                  other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are
                  generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact
                  antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of
                  TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce
                  the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4.
                  Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect
                  in many-species systems than expected from independent
                  combination of modifications measured in systems with
                  relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs
                  may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level
                  perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are
                  implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many
                  types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a
                  complete understanding of their effects may require theory
                  that distinguishes different 'functional groups' of modifiers
                  and addresses how these are structured according to trophic
                  relationships.},

                  behaviors can have important effects on food webs. One
                  consequence may be to change how readily perturbations
                  propagate through the web, because species' behaviors as well
                  as densities may respond to perturbations. It is not well
                  understood which types of behavior are more likely to
                  facilitate versus inhibit propagation of disturbances through
                  a food web, or how this might be affected by the shape of a
                  food web or the patterns of interaction strengths within it.
                  We model two simple, laterally expanded food webs (one with
                  three trophic levels and one with four), and compare how
                  various adaptive behaviors affect the potential for a newly
                  introduced predator to change the equilibrium densities of
                  distant species. Patterns of changes in response to the
                  introduction were qualitatively similar across most models, as
                  were the ways in which patterns of direct interaction
                  strengths affected those responses. Depending on both the web
                  structure and the specific adaptive behavior, the potential
                  for density changes to propagate through the web could be
                  either increased or diminished relative to the no-behavior
                  model. Two behaviors allowed density changes to propagate
                  through a four-level web that precluded such propagation in
                  the no-behavior model, and each of these two behaviors led to
                  qualitatively different patterns of density changes. In the
                  one model (diet choice) in which density changes were able to
                  propagate in both web structures, patterns of density changes
                  differed qualitatively between webs. Some of our results
                  flowed from the fact that behaviors did not interact directly
                  in the systems we considered, so that indirect effects on
                  distant species had to be at least partly density-mediated.
                  Our models highlight this as an inherent limitation of
                  considering in isolation behaviors that are strictly
                  foraging-related or strictly defense-related, making a case

                  to maintain ecosystem integrity because they are mostly based
                  on rarity status of organisms rather than functional
                  significance. Alternatively, approaches focusing on the
                  protection of ecological networks lead to more appropriate
                  conservation targets to maintain ecosystem integrity. We
                  propose that a shift in focus from species to interaction
                  networks is necessary to achieve pressing conservation
                  management and restoration ecology goals of conserving
                  biodiversity, ecosystem processes and ultimately
                  landscape‐scale delivery of ecosystem services. Using topical
                  examples from the literature, we discuss historical and
                  conceptual advances, current challenges and ways to move
                  forward. We also propose a road map to ecological network
                  conservation, providing a novel ready to use approach to
                  identify clear conservation targets with flexible data

                  environmental and spatial constraints affect the nature and

                  ability to predict their response to change and to conserve
                  them. This will better protect species, ecosystem processes,

                  research has focused too much on biodiversity per se, and too
                  little on the biological structure that maintains ecosystems.
                  Recent work on food webs suggests that habitat homogenization
                  and the loss of mobile predators from the top of the food
                  chain is seriously reducing the robustness of whole ecosystems
                  in the face of change. Time, therefore, to replace species

                  biotic component of ecosystems, in terms of both biomass and
                  number of species, they are rarely considered in conservation
                  planning, except where they are thought to pose a threat to
                  the conservation of their hosts. In this review, we address a
                  number of unresolved questions concerning parasite
                  conservation. Arguments for conserving parasite species refer
                  to the intrinsic value conferred by their evolutionary
                  heritage and potential, their functional role in the provision
                  of ecosystem services, and their value as indicators of
                  ecosystem quality. We propose that proper consideration of
                  these arguments mean that it is not logically defensible to
                  automatically exclude parasite species from conservation
                  decisions; rather, endangered hosts and parasites should be
                  considered together as a threatened ecological community. The
                  extent to which parasites are threatened with extinction is
                  difficult to estimate with any degree of confidence, because
                  so many parasite species have yet to be identified and, even
                  for those which have been formally described, we have limited
                  information on the factors affecting their distribution and
                  abundance. This lack of ecological information may partially
                  explain the under-representation of parasites on threatened
                  species lists. Effective conservation of parasites requires
                  maintaining access to suitable hosts and the ecological
                  conditions that permit successful transmission between hosts.
                  When implementing recovery plans for threatened host species,
                  this may be best achieved by attempting to restore the
                  ecological conditions that maintain the host and its parasite
                  fauna in dynamic equilibrium. Ecosystem-centred conservation
                  may be a more effective strategy than species-centred (or
                  host-parasite community-centred) approaches for preventing
                  extinction of parasites, but the criteria which are typically
                  used to identify protected areas do not provide information on
                  the ecological conditions required for effective transmission.
                  We propose a simple decision tree to aid the identification of
                  appropriate conservation actions for threatened parasites.},

                  synergistic or antagonistic effects. Our knowledge of when and
                  how interactions arise is limited, as most models and
                  experiments only consider the effect of a small number of
                  non-interacting stressors at one or few scales of ecological
                  organization. This is concerning because it could lead to
                  significant underestimations or overestimations of threats to

                  their population due to habitat loss and fragmentation across
                  their historical ranges. Multi-scale habitat suitability
                  models (HSM) can inform forest managers to aim their
                  conservation efforts at increasing the suitable habitat for
                  tigers by providing information regarding the scale-dependent
                  habitat-species relationships. However the current gap of
                  knowledge about ecological relationships driving species
                  distribution reduces the applicability of traditional and
                  classical statistical approaches such as generalized linear
                  models (GLMs), or occupancy surveys to produce accurate
                  predictive maps. This study investigates the multi-scale
                  habitat relationships of tigers and leopards and the impacts
                  of future climate change on their distribution using a
                  machine-learning algorithm random forest (RF). The recent
                  advancements in the machine-learning algorithms provide a
                  powerful tool for building accurate predictive models of
                  species distribution and their habitat relationships even when
                  little ecological knowledge is available about the species. We
                  collected species occurrence data using camera traps and
                  indirect evidence of animal presences (scats) in the field
                  over 2 years of rigorous sampling and used a machine-learning
                  algorithm random forest (RF) to predict the habitat
                  suitability maps of tiger and leopard under current and future
                  climatic scenarios. We developed niche overlap models based on
                  the recently developed statistical approaches to assess the
                  patterns of niche similarity between tigers and leopards.
                  Tiger and leopard utilized habitat resources at the broadest
                  spatial scales (28,000 m). Our model predicted a 23\% loss in
                  the suitable habitat of tigers under the RCP 8.5 Scenario
                  (2050). Our study of multi-scale habitat suitability modeling
                  provides valuable information on the species habitat
                  relationships in disturbed and human-dominated landscapes
                  concerning two large felid species of conservation importance.
                  These areas may act as refugee habitats for large carnivores
                  in the future and thus should be the focus of conservation
                  importance. This study may also provide a methodological
                  framework for similar multi-scale and multi-species monitoring
                  programs using robust and more accurate machine learning

                  species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis
                  on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community
                  contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to
                  quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose
                  a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental
                  niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data.Location
                  Europe, North America and South America.Methods The framework
                  applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in
                  gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche
                  overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We
                  use this framework and simulated species with pre‐defined
                  distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several
                  ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for
                  quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with
                  data on two well‐studied invasive species.Results We show that
                  niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework
                  when variables driving the distributions are known. The method
                  is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related
                  to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of
                  environmental conditions that occur across geographical space.
                  The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from
                  geographical space to multivariate environmental space
                  independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of
                  resolution in environmental space. However, the use of
                  ordination and species distribution model techniques for
                  selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche
                  overlap is calculated provide contrasting results.Main
                  conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust
                  methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for
                  studying niche differences between species, subspecies or
                  intra‐specific lineages that differ in their geographical
                  distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the
                  degree to which the environmental niche of a species or
                  intra‐specific lineage has changed over time.},

                  Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in
                  remote sensing and other fields. This article examines five
                  different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the
                  first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties
                  mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically,
                  with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and
                  the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to

                  comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix
                  with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity
                  disagreement and allocation disagreement. This article shows
                  how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from

                  snapshots in time, species ranges may fall short of
                  representing all of the geographic or environmental space that
                  they are able to occupy. This has important implications for
                  niche studies yet most comparative studies overlook the
                  transient nature of species distributions and assume that they
                  are at equilibrium. We review the methods most widely used for
                  niche comparisons today and suggest a modified framework to
                  describe and compare niches based on snapshot species range
                  data. First, we introduce a new environmental space-based
                  Niche Equivalence Statistic to test niche similarity between
                  two species, which explicitly incorporates the spatial
                  distribution of environments and their availability into
                  statistical tests. We also introduce a new Background
                  Statistic to measure the ability of this Niche Equivalence
                  Statistic to detect differences based on the available
                  environmental-space. These metrics enable fair comparisons
                  between different geographies when the ranges of species are
                  out of equilibrium. Based on distinct parameterizations of the
                  new Equivalence and Background statistics, we then propose a
                  Niche Divergence Test and a Niche Overlap Test, which allow
                  assessment of whether differences between species emerge from
                  true niche divergences. These methods are implemented in a new
                  R package, ‘humboldt’ and applied to simulated species with
                  pre-defined niches. The new methods improve accuracy of niche
                  similarity and associated tests – consistently outperforming
                  other tests. We show that the quantification of niche
                  similarity should be performed only in environmental space,
                  which is less sensitive than geographic space to the spatial
                  abundance of key environmental variables. Further, our methods
                  characterize the relationships between non-analogous and
                  analogous climates in the species’ distributions, something
                  not available previously. These improvements allow assessment
                  of whether the different environmental spaces occupied by two
                  taxa emerge from true niche evolution, as opposed to
                  differences in life history and biological interactors, or
                  differences in the variety and configuration of environments
                  accessible to them.},

                  (HPIAV) has been detected in dairy cows in the United States.
                  Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded,
                  RNA virus that has not previously been associated with
                  widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an
                  extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV
                  receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound
                  to galactose in either an α2,3 or α2,6 linkage. Human IAVs
                  preferentially bind SA-α2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian
                  IAVs have a preference for α2,3 (avian receptor). The avian
                  receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs
                  isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to
                  SA-α2,3-Gal-β1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated
                  from duck to SA-α2,3-Gal-β1,3 (duck receptor). We found all
                  receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the
                  mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or
                  dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely
                  expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken
                  receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a
                  low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of
                  the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale
                  for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine
                  milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing
                  vessel for novel IAV generation.},

                  present a solvable example of such a feedback mechanism in a
                  generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamical system. Beginning with a
                  community of species interacting on a network with arbitrary
                  degree distribution, we provide an analytical framework from
                  which properties of the eventual `surviving community' can be
                  derived. We find that highly-connected species are less likely
                  to survive than their poorly connected counterparts, which
                  skews the eventual degree distribution towards a preponderance
                  of species with low degree, a pattern commonly observed in
                  real ecosystems. Further, the average abundance of the
                  neighbours of a species in the surviving community is lower
                  than the community average (reminiscent of the famed
                  friendship paradox). Finally, we show that correlations emerge
                  between the connectivity of a species and its interactions
                  with its neighbours. More precisely, we find that
                  highly-connected species tend to benefit from their neighbours
                  more than their neighbours benefit from them. These
                  correlations are not present in the initial pool of species
                  and are a result of the dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are
                  central to understanding the shared evolutionary history of
                  organisms. Inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree
                  by any optimality criterion (e.g., maximum likelihood) is an
                  NP-hard problem, propelling the development of myriad
                  heuristic approaches. Yet, these heuristics often lack a
                  systematic means of uniformly sampling random trees or
                  effectively exploring a tree space that grows factorially,
                  which are crucial to optimisation problems such as machine
                  learning. Accordingly, we present Phylo2Vec, a new
                  parsimonious representation of a phylogenetic tree. Phylo2Vec
                  maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to an integer vector of
                  length $n$. We prove that Phylo2Vec is both well-defined and
                  bijective to the space of phylogenetic trees. The advantages
                  of Phylo2Vec are twofold: i) easy uniform sampling of binary
                  trees and ii) systematic ability to traverse tree space in
                  very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use
                  Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world
                  datasets and show that a simple hill climbing-based
                  optimisation efficiently traverses the vastness of tree space
                  from a random to an optimal tree.},

                  the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival
                  of a focal species in complex environments. However,
                  extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal
                  networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions limiting
                  their scope. Here, we develop a multilayer network model of
                  competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how
                  spatially structured environments impact species coexistence
                  and ecosystem stability. We show that homogeneous environments
                  always lead to monodominance unless all species' fitness
                  parameters are in an exact trade-off. However, this precise
                  fine-tuning does not guarantee coexistence in generic
                  heterogeneous environments. By introducing general spatial
                  disorder in the model, we solve it exactly in the mean-field
                  limit, finding that stable coexistence becomes possible in the
                  presence of strong disorder. Crucially, coexistence is
                  supported by the spontaneous localization of species through
                  the emergence of ecological niches. Our results remain
                  qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where
                  topological features can improve species coexistence. Finally,
                  we employ our model to study how correlated disorder promotes
                  spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and
                  riverine landscapes. Our work provides a novel framework to
                  understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in
                  metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological
                  interactions.},

                  and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a
                  study that systematically compared models for a university
                  community, which has a much smaller but more connected
                  population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic

                  model based on ordinary differential equations. All three
                  models represented the disease progression with the same
                  susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We
                  created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000
                  students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for
                  combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact

                  approaches to each other using a synthetic population. For
                  each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of
                  persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. We
                  evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and
                  evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The
                  agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment
                  model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to
                  and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary
                  differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The
                  ABM's computation time was much greater than the other two
                  models' computation time. The DCM captured some of the

                  nations, ascribed a higher value to some lives, and allowed
                  some groups to extract, exploit and subjugate others.1–4 The
                  persistent echoes of these origins are seen everywhere,
                  particularly in the way we use terms that classify countries
                  and people: rich versus poor nations; resource-rich versus
                  resource-limited settings; First versus Third World; Old
                  versus New World; developed versus developing countries;
                  high-income countries (HICs) versus low/middle-income
                  countries (LMICs); global North versus global South;
                  beneficiaries versus donors; white versus Black Indigenous and
                  People of Color (BIPOC) and so on (see Table 1). The terms
                  ‘global’ or its much-used counterpart ‘international’ imply a
                  world outside rich nations (often seen as the epicentre of
                  everything progressive and ‘good’); a world which needs
                  development or health assistance. The fact that these implicit
                  connotations are largely unchallenged in most global health
                  and global development institutions in HICs itself is
                  worrisome and illustrates how both these sectors continue to
                  be steeped in white supremacy and saviorism.2 Even terms
                  originally coined without a connotation of hierarchy, such as
                  global North versus global South (or West vs East), end up
                  implying hierarchies given these divisions are based on access
                  to wealth and political power. The temptation to categorise
                  and dichotomise is very powerful and pervasive. All of us have
                  used some of these terms at some point in our professions and
                  activities. Some terms such as the now defunct ‘First World vs
                  Third World’ imply racism in terms of hierarchy; the notion
                  that some are first and others behind.5 Most people today

                  that emerged in domestic waterfowl in 1996. Over the past
                  decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans,
                  has been reported. Although human to human transmission is
                  rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who
                  have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing
                  presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises
                  substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically
                  naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.
                  Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was
                  historically used to track polio and has recently been
                  implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing
                  approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in
                  nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in
                  the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April
                  25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered
                  all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade
                  2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one
                  detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over
                  seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests
                  avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially
                  humans, could not be excluded. We report the value of

                  example of coevolution, a process in which mutually dependent
                  species influence each other's evolution. Plants depend on
                  hummingbirds for pollination, whereas hummingbirds rely on
                  nectar for food. As a step towards understanding coevolution,
                  this review focuses on the macroevolutionary consequences of
                  plant-hummingbird interactions, a relatively underexplored
                  area in the current literature. We synthesize prior studies,
                  illustrating the origins and dynamics of hummingbird
                  pollination across different angiosperm clades previously
                  pollinated by insects (mostly bees), bats, and passerine
                  birds. In some cases, the crown age of hummingbirds pre-dates
                  the plants they pollinate. In other cases, plant groups
                  transitioned to hummingbird pollination early in the
                  establishment of this bird group in the Americas, with the
                  build-up of both diversities coinciding temporally, and hence
                  suggesting co-diversification. Determining what triggers
                  shifts to and away from hummingbird pollination remains a
                  major open challenge. The impact of hummingbirds on plant
                  diversification is complex, with many tropical plant lineages

                  that attract hummingbirds, and others experiencing no change

                  and as individual species (e.g. traits, foraging behaviour,

                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

                  This model has gained renewed interest in the context of
                  random interaction networks. One of the debated questions is
                  understanding how the number of species in the system, $n$,
                  influences the stability of the model. Robert May demonstrated
                  that large systems become unstable, unless species-species
                  interactions vanish. This outcome has frequently been
                  interpreted as a universal phenomenon and summarised as "large
                  systems are unstable". However, May's results were performed
                  on a specific type of graphs (Erdős-Rényi), whereas we explore
                  a different class of networks and we show that the competitive
                  Lotka-Volterra system maintains stability even in the limit of
                  large $n$, despite non-vanishing interaction strength. We
                  establish a lower bound on the interspecific interaction
                  strength, formulated in terms of the maximum and minimum
                  degrees of the ecological network, rather than being dependent
                  upon the network's size. For values below this threshold,
                  coexistence of all species is attained in the asymptotic
                  limit. In other words, the outlier nodes with large degree
                  cause instability, rather than the large number of species in
                  the system. Our result refines May's bound, by showing that
                  the type of network model is relevant and can lead to
                  completely different results.},

                  should favor specialists because there are tradeoffs limiting
                  the fitness of generalists in any of the alternative hosts or
                  because evolution proceeds faster with narrower niches. Here
                  we review experiments showing that virus adaptation to a
                  specific host is often coupled with fitness losses in
                  alternative ones. In most instances, mutations beneficial in
                  one host are detrimental in another. This antagonistic
                  pleiotropy should limit the range of adaptation and promote
                  the evolution of specialization. However, when hosts fluctuate

                  host types. We have particularly explored under which

                  coexist with specialist strains or even dominate the

                  conditions for stability of nine identified equilibria and
                  provided biological interpretation in terms of the infection
                  rates for the viral specialist and generalist strains. By

                  purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in
                  related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects

                  absent. We cannot determine whether such species are truly
                  neglected, or whether efforts to recover them are not included

                  type, and predict undetected viral carriers. Our results
                  indicate that bat species with longer life spans, broad
                  geographic distributions in the eastern hemisphere, and large
                  group sizes carry more viruses overall. Life span was a
                  stronger predictor of deoxyribonucleic acid viral diversity,
                  while group size and family were more important for predicting

                  viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address
                  the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to
                  host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents,
                  another important host order. We found that bats indeed host
                  more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we
                  identified life-history and ecological factors that promote
                  zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by
                  species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of
                  other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry).
                  Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased
                  zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one
                  young), greater longevity and more litters per year.
                  Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain
                  in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the
                  stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared
                  between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission
                  is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats
                  host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of
                  zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in
                  rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the
                  number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents
                  should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging
                  viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and
                  perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive
                  framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus

                  independently developed in mammals. Flight is among the most
                  energy-consuming activities. Thus, we deduced that changes in
                  energy metabolism must be a primary factor in the origin of
                  flight in bats. The respiratory chain of the mitochondrial
                  produces 95\% of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) needed for
                  locomotion. Because the respiratory chain has a dual genetic
                  foundation, with genes encoded by both the mitochondrial and
                  nuclear genomes, we examined both genomes to gain insights
                  into the evolution of flight within mammals. Evidence for
                  positive selection was detected in 23.08\% of the
                  mitochondrial-encoded and 4.90\% of nuclear-encoded oxidative
                  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, but in only 2.25\% of the
                  nuclear-encoded nonrespiratory genes that function in
                  mitochondria or 1.005\% of other nuclear genes in bats. To
                  address the caveat that the two available bat genomes are of
                  only draft quality, we resequenced 77 OXPHOS genes from four
                  species of bats. The analysis of the resequenced gene data are
                  in agreement with our conclusion that a significantly higher
                  proportion of genes involved in energy metabolism, compared
                  with background genes, show evidence of adaptive evolution
                  specific on the common ancestral bat lineage. Both
                  mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes display
                  evidence of adaptive evolution along the common ancestral
                  branch of bats, supporting our hypothesis that genes involved
                  in energy metabolism were targets of natural selection and
                  allowed adaptation to the huge change in energy demand that
                  were required during the origin of flight.},

                  in the Americas, i.e. New World Hantaviruses (NWH). First, we
                  considered the circulation of pathogenic NWH among Cricetidae
                  rodents, by inferring the phylogenetic links among 277 genomic
                  samples of the S segment (N protein) of NWH found in 55
                  species. Second, we used machine learning to assess the impact
                  of land use on the probability of presence of the rodent
                  species linked with reservoirs of pathogenic Hantaviruses. Our
                  results show that hosts are widely present across the

                  agricultural land, but not in the secondary forest, whereas
                  other hosts are present in secondary forest and agricultural
                  land. The diversity of host species allows Hantavirus to
                  circulate in a wide spectrum of habitats, in particular rural
                  rather than urban. We highlight that public repositories of
                  genomic data and species occurrence are very useful resources
                  for monitoring potential enzootic transmission and spillover

                  cross‐species disease transmission, which incurs economic
                  costs and threatens wildlife conservation. Wild waterfowl are
                  natural hosts of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), are often
                  abundant near poultry farms, and have been linked to outbreaks
                  of AIVs in poultry. Interspecific and seasonal variation in
                  waterfowl movement and habitat use means that the risk of
                  disease transmission between wild birds and poultry inevitably
                  varies across species, space, and time. Here, we used GPS
                  telemetry data from 10 waterfowl species in and near
                  California's Central Valley, a region where both wild
                  waterfowl and domestic poultry are abundant, to study
                  selection of poultry farms by waterfowl across diel, seasonal,
                  and annual cycles. We found that waterfowl selected for
                  wetlands, open water, protected areas, and croplands, which
                  meant that they generally avoided habitats that were likely to
                  be used for poultry farming. These selection patterns were
                  linked to species' ecology and diel behavioral patterns, such
                  that avoidance of poultry habitats was stronger for local or
                  partial migrants than for long‐distance migrants, and stronger
                  during daytime than at night. We then combined these habitat
                  selection results with data on poultry farm locations to map
                  risk of waterfowl–poultry contact across the Central Valley.
                  Average selection strength at poultry farms was low,
                  suggesting that current placement of poultry farms is
                  generally effective for limiting risk of contact with wild
                  birds. When we combined these habitat selection results with
                  data on species' abundances and AIV infection prevalence, we
                  found dramatic variation in potential AIV transmission risk

  abstract     = {Symbionts tend to be aggregated on their hosts, such that few
                  hosts harbor the majority of symbionts. This ubiquitous
                  pattern can result from stochastic processes, but aggregation
                  patterns may also depend on the type of host–symbiont
                  interaction, along with traits that affect host exposure and
                  susceptibility to symbionts. Untangling how aggregation
                  patterns both within and among populations depend on
                  stochastic processes, interaction type and host traits remains
                  an outstanding challenge. Here, we address this challenge by
                  using null models to compare aggregation patterns in a neutral
                  system of Balanomorpha barnacles attached to patellid limpets
                  and a host–parasite system of Gyrodactylus spp. monogeneans
                  and their Trinidadian guppy Poecilia reticulata hosts. We
                  first used a model to predict patterns of symbiont–host
                  aggregation due to random partitioning of symbionts to hosts.
                  This null model accurately predicted the aggregation of
                  barnacles on limpets, but the degree of aggregation varied
                  across 303 quadrats. Quadrats with larger limpets had less
                  aggregated barnacles, whereas aggregation increased with
                  variation in limpet size. Across 84 guppy populations,
                  Gyrodactylus spp. parasites were significantly less aggregated
                  than predicted by the null model. As in the neutral
                  limpet–barnacle system, aggregation decreased with mean host
                  size. Parasites were significantly less aggregated on males
                  than females because male guppies tended to have higher
                  prevalence and lower parasite burdens than predicted by the
                  null model. Together, these results suggest stochastic
                  processes can explain aggregation patterns in neutral but not
                  parasitic systems, though in both systems host traits affect
                  aggregation patterns. Because the distribution of symbionts on
                  hosts can affect symbiont evolution via intraspecific
                  interactions, and host behavior and evolution via
                  host–symbiont interactions, identifying the drivers of
                  aggregation enriches our understanding of host–symbiont
                  interactions.},

                  forests are simultaneously attacked by multiple pathogens.
                  Usually, the impacts of each pathogen are studied separately,
                  however, interactions between them can affect disease
                  dynamics. Pathogens can interact directly by competing for the
                  same niche, but also facilitate or suppress each other via
                  indirect effects through the host. We studied 66 native
                  Mediterranean Pinus nigra stands located in the Pyrenees which
                  were affected by two pathogens with different structural
                  specificity: Dothistroma pini causing Dothistroma needle
                  blight and Diplodia sapinea causing Diplodia shoot blight. We
                  explored the ecology of both pathogens and whether the
                  diseases they caused had an impact on trees and recruits. No
                  signs of competition were found on adult trees. Diplodia shoot
                  blight was restricted to the warmest and driest areas, while
                  no climatic restrictions were identified for Dothistroma
                  needle blight. Both diseases caused additive effects on crown
                  defoliation and defoliated trees showed stagnated growth. In
                  the regeneration layer, signs of disease suppression were
                  found. In the warmest and driest areas, seedling mortality was
                  mainly associated with Diplodia shoot blight, even though both
                  pathogens were detected. Clear signs of D. pini spillover from
                  canopy trees to recruits were found. However, seedling
                  mortality caused by Dothistroma needle blight was only
                  restricted to the coldest and wettest sites where D. sapinea
                  could not survive. Large crowns in adult trees probably allow
                  both pathogens to co‐exist and cause additive impacts. The
                  smaller size of recruits and a higher susceptibility to
                  environmental stress compared to adult trees probably
                  facilitates the effects of Diplodia shoot blight which masked
                  those caused by Dothistroma needle blight. By considering
                  climatic constraints, host ontogeny and structural
                  specificity, we could dissect the disease impacts of two
                  different pathogens and successfully explain forest health at

                  role that temporal and environmental variability, spatially
                  distinct locations and different hosts may have in the
                  epidemiology of a plant disease and in the microevolution of
                  its causative pathogen. In California and southern Oregon
                  (USA), the introduction of the invasive pathogen Phytophthora
                  ramorum, causal agent of the widespread disease Sudden Oak
                  Death (SOD), has resulted in extensive mortality of various
                  oaks Quercus sp. and of tanoak Notholithocarpus densiflorus.
                  Although the disease can infect over a hundred hosts,
                  California bay laurel Umbellularia californica is the most
                  competent transmissive host but is not lethally affected by
                  the disease. Using population genetics data, we identify the
                  relationship among P. ramorum populations in bay laurels, oaks
                  and tanoaks to clarify the contribution of each host on the
                  epidemiology of SOD and on the microevolution of its causal
                  agent and to explore differences in population structure
                  across sites and years. We conclude that bay laurel is the
                  primary source for infections of both tanoak and oak, and that
                  tanoak contributes minimally to oak infection but can infect
                  bay laurel, creating a secondary pathogen amplification
                  process. Overall, pathogen diversity is associated with
                  rainfall and presence of bay laurels, which sustain the
                  largest populations of the pathogen. Additionally, we clarify
                  that while bay laurels are a common source of inoculum, oaks
                  and tanoaks act as sinks that maintain host‐specific pathogen
                  genotypes not observed in bay laurel populations. Finally, we
                  conclude that different sites support a dominance of different
                  pathogen genotypes. Some genotypes were widespread, while
                  others were limited to a subset of the plots. Sites with
                  higher bay laurel densities sustained a higher genotypic
                  diversity of the pathogen. This work provides novel insight

                  declining worldwide, threatening the functioning of the
                  ecosystem service they provide. The factors driving this
                  change are manifold, but land use changes and interspecific
                  transmission of pathogens between managed and wild bees are
                  prominent. In this context, most research efforts have focused
                  on specific taxa and rarely at the community level, limiting
                  our ability to fully understand the effects of global change
                  on the functioning of plant–pollinator interactions in
                  ecosystems.Here, we investigate the impact of human activities
                  (beekeeping and land use intensity) on the spread of an
                  emergent pathogen Vairimorpha ceranae in Mediterranean wild
                  bee communities inhabiting landscapes with varying levels of
                  anthropogenic disturbance. Plant–pollinator interactions were
                  sampled in nine one‐hectare plots along a gradient of land use
                  (urban structures, croplands and natural vegetation) and
                  beekeeping intensity. We analysed the impact of human
                  disturbances on pollination networks and pathogen prevalence,
                  and applied a network approach to examine whether total
                  effects of species in networks (i.e. direct plus indirect
                  interactions) explain pathogen spread through bee
                  communities.We found that V. ceranae prevalence in honey bees
                  is not a good predictor of the pathogen spread through bee
                  communities. There seems to be a temporal mismatch between
                  pathogen dynamics in managed and wild bees. Networks with more
                  diversity of interactions and more plants showed less pathogen
                  prevalence, but total effect analyses (i.e. combining direct
                  and indirect interactions) failed to explain pathogen
                  transmission across pollination networks. Croplands increased
                  wild bee density, and interactions and species diversity in
                  networks, while shrublands had the opposite effect. Our
                  results highlight the importance of studying pathogen dynamics
                  at the community level and analysing species interaction
                  patterns to improve our understanding of pathogen spread

                  management. However, biogeography has rarely been integrated
                  into human or veterinary medicine nor routinely leveraged for
                  global health management. Here we review the theory and
                  application of biogeography to the research and management of
                  human infectious diseases, an integration we refer to as
                  'pathogeography'. Pathogeography represents a promising
                  framework for understanding and decomposing the spatial
                  distributions, diversity patterns and emergence risks of human
                  infectious diseases into interpretable components of dynamic
                  socio-ecological systems. Analytical tools from biogeography
                  are already helping to improve our understanding of individual
                  infectious disease distributions and the processes that shape
                  them in space and time. At higher levels of organization,
                  biogeographical studies of diseases are rarer but increasing,
                  improving our ability to describe and explain patterns that
                  emerge at the level of disease communities (e.g.
                  co-occurrence, diversity patterns, biogeographic
                  regionalisation). Even in a highly globalized world most human
                  infectious diseases remain constrained in their geographic
                  distributions by ecological barriers to the dispersal or
                  establishment of their causal pathogens, reservoir hosts
                  and/or vectors. These same processes underpin the spatial
                  arrangement of other taxa, such as mammalian biodiversity,
                  providing a strong empirical 'prior' with which to assess the
                  potential distributions of infectious diseases when data on
                  their occurrence is unavailable or limited. In the absence of
                  quality data, generalized biogeographic patterns could provide
                  the earliest (and in some cases the only) insights into the

                  totaled >540,000 ha during 2001-2004, peaking at 23\% of 2003
                  annual deforestation. Cropland deforestation averaged twice
                  the size of clearings for pasture (mean sizes, 333 and 143 ha,
                  respectively), and conversion occurred rapidly; >90\% of
                  clearings for cropland were planted in the first year after
                  deforestation. Area deforested for cropland and mean annual
                  soybean price in the year of forest clearing were directly
                  correlated (R(2) = 0.72), suggesting that deforestation rates
                  could return to higher levels seen in 2003-2004 with a rebound
                  of crop prices in international markets. Pasture remains the
                  dominant land use after forest clearing in Mato Grosso, but
                  the growing importance of larger and faster conversion of
                  forest to cropland defines a new paradigm of forest loss in
                  Amazonia and refutes the claim that agricultural

                  and virological factors. The host range of an influenza A
                  virus is determined by species-specific interactions between
                  virus and host cell factors. These include the ability to bind

                  In this Review, we examine the host barriers that influenza A

                  interventions, and priorities for anthropological engagement.
                  It takes an inclusive approach to anthropological praxis by
                  engaging with the work of nonanthropologist “allies,”
                  including qualitative researchers, social workers, and allied
                  experts. The article narrates how the concept of
                  “anthropology” came to serve as a semantic marker of
                  solidarity with local populations, respect for customary
                  practices and local sociopolitical realities, and an avowed

                  from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public
                  health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic
                  spillover requires several factors to align, including the

                  propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission
                  that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework
                  reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a

                  in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally

                  these regions, pteropodids have been identified as natural
                  reservoir hosts for henipaviruses. The genus Henipavirus
                  includes Hendra virus and Nipah virus, which regularly spill
                  over from bats to domestic animals and humans in Australia and
                  Asia, and a suite of largely uncharacterized African
                  henipaviruses. Rapid change in fruit bat habitat and
                  associated shifts in their ecology and behavior are well

                  infectious diseases are increasing, causing losses in both
                  human and animal lives, as well as large costs to society.
                  Many factors are contributing to disease emergence, including
                  climate change, globalization and urbanization, and most of
                  these factors are to some extent caused by humans. Pathogens
                  may be more or less prone to emergence in themselves, and
                  rapidly mutating viruses are more common among the emerging
                  pathogens. The climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are
                  likely to be emerging due to climate changes and environmental
                  changes, such as increased irrigation. This review lists the
                  factors within pathogens that make them prone to emergence,
                  and the modes of transmission that are affected. The

                  interaction of factors involving the host, agent, and
                  environment, the population may be resistant to infection or
                  may become a dead-end host, a spillover host, or a maintenance

                  with predators consuming increasingly larger prey and feeding
                  at higher trophic levels as they grow. Gape limitation and
                  ontogenetic diet shifts are key mechanisms by which size
                  structuring arises in these communities. Little is known,
                  however, about size structuring in coral reef fishes. Here, we
                  aimed to advance understanding of size structuring in coral
                  reef food webs by examining the evidence for these mechanisms
                  in two groups of reef predators. Given the diversity of
                  feeding modes amongst coral reef fishes, we also compared gape
                  size-body size allometric relationships across functional
                  groups to determine whether they are reliable indicators of
                  size structuring. We used gut content analysis and quantile
                  regressions of predator size-prey size relationships to test
                  for evidence of gape limitation and ontogenetic niche shifts
                  in reef piscivores (n = 13 species) and benthic invertivores
                  (n = 3 species). We then estimated gape size-body size
                  allometric scaling coefficients for 21 different species from
                  four functional groups, including herbivores/detritivores,
                  which are not expected to be gape-limited. We found evidence
                  of both mechanisms for size structuring in coral reef
                  piscivores, with maximum prey size scaling positively with
                  predator body size, and ontogenetic diet shifts including prey
                  type and expansion of prey size. There was, however, little
                  evidence of size structuring in benthic invertivores. Across
                  species and functional groups, absolute and relative gape
                  sizes were largest in piscivores as expected, but gape
                  size-body size scaling relationships were not indicative of

                  allometry was not indicative of size structuring, it may have
                  implications for ecosystem function: positively allometric
                  gape size-body size scaling relationships in
                  herbivores/detritivores suggests that loss of large-bodied

                  single agency issues that require intervention or monitoring
                  at one spatial scale. A master sample can be used to
                  coordinate and scale monitoring designs to ensure consistency
                  in information gathered and robustness of estimators at the
                  different spatial scales. We propose using balanced acceptance
                  sampling (BAS) to generate a master sample. In this context,
                  practical applications and justification of BAS as a master
                  sample are addressed. These include sample generation,
                  stratification, unequal probability sampling, rotating panel
                  designs, and regional intensification. A method for
                  incorporating legacy sites is also provided. Using BAS as a
                  master sample is conceptually simple, gives good spatial
                  balance over different spatial scales, and is computationally
                  efficient to generate. An example for terrestrial biodiversity
                  monitoring in New Zealand is provided. Environmental
                  monitoring can benefit from increased coordination between
                  agencies. A master sample is an excellent way to incorporate
                  coordination directly into the sample design. BAS improves on
                  methods previously described and provides an effective method
                  to monitor populations at multiple spatial scales.},

                  for specific leaf area (SLA) available within the largest and
                  most frequently used global plant trait database, the TRY
                  Plant Trait Database, exploring how much of the data were
                  applicable (i.e., original, representative, logical, and
                  comparable) and traceable (i.e., published, cited, and
                  consistent). Over three‐quarters of the SLA data in TRY either
                  lacked applicability or traceability, leaving only 22.9\% of
                  the original data usable compared with the 64.9\% typically
                  deemed usable by standard data cleaning protocols. The

                  expansion, can negatively influence a lake's capacity to
                  provide aquatic ecosystem services (ES). However, identifying
                  lakes most at risk of losing their ES (i.e., higher
                  vulnerability) requires integrating information on lake
                  ecological state, global change threats, and ES use. Here, we

                  ecological state of 659 lakes across Canada. Using the
                  deviation of impacted lakes from reference ones, we identified

                  developed areas were linked to higher lake vulnerability and

               interactions allow communities of species to persist through time
               through both neutral and adaptive processes. Despite their
               importance, a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and
               forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This
               knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data—although
               species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade,
               species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the
               effort required to sample interactions. This means there are many
               interactions between species that occur in nature, but we do not
               know these interactions occur because we have never observed
               them. These so-called “false-negatives” bias data and hinder
               inference about the structure and dynamics of interaction
               networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized rate of
               false-negatives in data can be quite high, even in thoroughly
               sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances
               across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of
               occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative
               rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate
               uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions
               of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is
               that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare
               because these species are less likely to encounter one-another
               than species of higher relative abundance, and that this can (in
               part) explain the common pattern of nestedness in bipartite
               interaction networks. However, we demonstrate that across several
               datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are
               positive associations between species co-occurrence and
               interactions, which suggests these interactions among “rare”
               species actually exist but simply are not observed. Finally, we
               assess how false negatives influence various models of network
               prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation
               error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the
               understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design
               monitoring schemes for species interactions.},

                  individuals, except during the rut. Accordingly, the rut
                  season stands out with greater male home ranges, greater home
                  range overlap and shorter distances between males and between
                  males and females, which could indicate that this season is
                  critical for disease transmission. Measures to prevent disease
                  spread should lower contact rates, e.g. by reducing the
                  abundance of adult males before they mix with other groups
                  during the rut. This can be achieved for instance by allowing
                  earlier hunt on adult males when they are distributed in small
                  male groups, to reduce the transmission risk and keep
                  disturbance of other individuals low.},

                  a diverse set of taxa, a related macroecological pattern, the
                  latitudinal specialization gradient (LSG), remains
                  controversial. A classical expectation is that species should
                  present more specialized interactions towards the equator,
                  however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence for
                  this hypothesis. Here, we tested the LSG in a set of
                  bird–malarial parasite networks across South America. Our
                  analyses comprise 9763 individual birds surveyed in 52
                  communities, within eight biomes and spanning a gradient of
                  4700 km. We measured network‐level specialization through
                  indices that account for increasingly comprehensive
                  information. Binary specialization considers the
                  occurrence/absence of interactions between each host–parasite
                  pair; quantitative specialization is also affected by the
                  frequency of interactions between each host–parasite pair; and
                  phylogenetic specialization takes into account the phylogeny
                  and abundances of host species. We found that, while binary
                  specialization increases towards the equator, quantitative
                  specialization decreases. Thus, despite each parasite lineage
                  infecting a more restricted set from the available host
                  species in low latitudes, infections were more evenly
                  distributed among host species, than in higher latitudes.
                  Additionally, using a structural equation model, we show that
                  both direct and indirect effects contribute to this unexpected
                  relationship. Direct effects are weak, and
                  network‐specialization was mostly explained by host species
                  and parasite lineage richness, evidencing that changes in
                  network specialization along latitude are in a large part
                  explained by the latitudinal diversity gradient for birds and
                  malarial‐parasites. In the light of the accumulated evidence
                  over the past years, reinforced by our findings, we suggest
                  that the classical latitudinal specialization hypothesis
                  should be reevaluated, making room for a theoretical framework
                  able to encompass the conflicting results.},

                  availability are two of the main factors responsible for
                  plasticity in habitat selection. Despite the need for habitat
                  selection models that can accurately predict animal
                  distribution given the plasticity in the selection process, no
                  study has assessed the synergistic effects of these factors on
                  habitat selection. We investigated density‐dependent
                  functional responses by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped
                  skunks (Mephitis mephitis), two of the main hosts of the
                  rabies virus in North America. We monitored 54 raccoons and 12
                  striped skunks with Global‐Positioning‐System collars in a
                  landscape dominated by corn fields and forest patches. We
                  built resource selection functions to evaluate if the
                  selection of corn fields varied with conspecific density and
                  corn field availability within 100\% minimum convex polygons.
                  Raccoons altered their selection of corn fields depending on
                  both conspecific density and corn‐forest edge density or corn
                  field proportion. In areas of low corn‐forest edge densities
                  and a low corn field proportion, raccoons showed stronger
                  selection for corn fields when few conspecifics were present.
                  At high conspecific densities, the selection of corn fields
                  was stronger in areas with high corn‐forest edge densities and
                  a low corn field proportion. For striped skunks, we did not
                  detect any synergistic effect of density‐dependence and
                  functional responses. Unlike raccoons, striped skunks
                  displayed a selection that was strongest for agricultural
                  corridors. We show that functional responses in habitat
                  selection can be density‐dependent. In a context of infectious
                  disease dynamics, modeling density‐dependence in functional
                  responses increases the ability to predict spatio‐temporal
                  variations in the distribution of reservoir species and thus,
                  to delineate areas at high animal densities where the risk of
                  disease outbreaks is relatively high. For example, the
                  omission of density‐dependence in functional responses
                  underestimated the relative probability of raccoon occurrence
                  in corn fields, while overestimating the relative probability
                  of occurrence in anthropogenic areas and wetlands. Our study
                  underscores the relevance of considering the complexity of
                  habitat selection by all hosts of a zoonosis. Cost‐effective
                  control and prevention programs used to limit disease spread
                  can benefit from accounting for density‐dependent functional

              yet little is known about its epidemiology. In particular, there
              is an ongoing debate regarding how Arctic rabies persists in its
              primary reservoir host, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), which
              exists in the ecosystem at very low population densities. To shed
              light on the mechanisms of rabies persistence in the Arctic, we
              built a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR)
              epidemiological model of rabies virus transmission in an Arctic
              fox population interacting with red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), a
              rabies host that is increasingly present in the Arctic. The model
              suggests that rabies cannot be maintained in resource-poor areas
              of the Arctic, characterized by low Arctic fox density, even in
              the presence of continuous reintroduction of the virus by infected
              Arctic foxes from neighbouring regions. However, in populations of
              relatively high Arctic fox density, rabies persists under
              conditions of higher transmission rate, prolonged infectious
              period and for a broad range of incubation periods. Introducing
              the strong cyclical dynamics of Arctic prey availability makes
              simulated rabies outbreaks less regular but more intense, with an
              onset that does not neatly track peaks in Arctic fox density.
              Finally, interaction between Arctic and red foxes increases the
              frequency and/or the intensity of rabies outbreaks in the Arctic
              fox population. Our work suggests that disruption of prey cycles
              and increasing interactions between Arctic and red foxes due to
              climate change and northern development may significantly change
              the epidemiology of rabies across the Arctic.}

                  close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts. The
                  contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in
                  the landscape because functional connectivity can affect
                  interactions between individuals. Yet few studies have
                  explored the interplay between contact rates, conspecific
                  density, and functional connectivity. Using a spatially
                  explicit individual-based model, we investigated how empirical
                  movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact
                  rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes. We developed
                  dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing
                  movement behaviors of radio-collared raccoons, which are the
                  main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus. On this basis, we
                  simulated space-use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes
                  varying in conspecific density, forest availability, and
                  landscape connectivity. We then characterized spatial patterns
                  in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated
                  raccoons. Radio-collared raccoons were more likely to choose
                  large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along
                  least-cost paths, and had relatively long residence times in
                  anthropogenic areas, especially during daytime. These movement
                  rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual
                  landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates.
                  First, few simulated raccoons were responsible for most
                  contacts between individuals, a pattern that emerged even
                  though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules.
                  Second, per capita contact rates increased linearly with
                  individual density under most conditions, which indicates that
                  raccoon rabies transmission should be density-dependent rather
                  than frequency-dependent. Third, functional connectivity
                  created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita
                  contact rates from decreasing to increasing values, depending
                  upon the availability of land cover types. Overall, the
                  contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in
                  forests, anthropogenic areas, and agricultural corridors. We
                  show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from
                  simple empirical movement rules and, therefore, can be key
                  drivers of disease spread dynamics. The strong spatial
                  heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the
                  effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly
                  vary depending upon host density, landscape composition, and
                  functional connectivity. This study provides key functional
                  relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local
                  conditions.}

                  values, ii) providing sources for citing input values, iii)
                  parameterising the model to different geographic regions, iv)
                  enabling meta-analyses for evaluating model structure, as well
                  as further contributing to parameterisation at specific
                  locations, and v) providing biologically appropriate parameter
                  input values for model sensitivity testing. The REDB is a
                  useful research resource that will increase in value with
                  ongoing inclusion of data from future raccoon and raccoon
                  rabies studies and serves as a model for database design and
                  research applications to other species. The database and an
                  empty database for use with other species are available online

  abstract     = {Urban mapping using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery
                  presents numerous challenges. These include spectral mixing of
                  diverse land cover components within pixels, spectral
                  confusion with other land cover features such as fallow
                  agricultural fields and the fact that urban classes of
                  interest are of the land use and not the land cover category.
                  A new methodology to address these issues is proposed. This
                  approach involves, as a first step, the generation of two
                  independent but rudimentary land cover products, one
                  spectral-based at the pixel level and the other segment-based.
                  These classifications are then merged through a rule-based
                  approach to generate a final product with enhanced land use
                  classes and accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of derived
                  products of Ottawa, Calgary and cities in southwestern Ontario
                  is presented based on conventional ground reference data as
                  well as inter-classification consistency analyses. Producer
                  accuracies of 78\% and 73\% have been achieved for urban
                  ‘residential’ and ‘commercial/industrial’ classes,
                  respectively. The capability of Landsat TM to detect low
                  density residential areas is assessed based on dwelling and
                  population data derived from aerial photography and the 2001
                  Canadian census. For low population densities (i.e. below 3000
                  persons/km2), density is observed to be monotonically related
                  to the fraction of pixels labeled ‘residential’. At higher
                  densities, the fraction of pixels labeled ‘residential’
                  remains constant due to Landsat's inability to distinguish
                  between high-rise apartment dwellings and
                  commercial/industrial structures.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Estimating rates of disease importation by
                  travellers is a key activity to assess both the risk to a
                  country from an infectious disease emerging elsewhere in the
                  world and the effectiveness of border measures. We describe a
                  model used to estimate the number of travellers infected with
                  SARS-CoV-2 into Canadian airports in 2021, and assess the
                  impact of pre-departure testing requirements on importation
                  risk. METHODS: A mathematical model estimated the number of
                  essential and non-essential air travellers infected with
                  SARS-CoV-2, with the latter requiring a negative pre-departure
                  test result. The number of travellers arriving infected (i.e.
                  imported cases) depended on air travel volumes, SARS-CoV-2
                  exposure risk in the departure country, prior infection or
                  vaccine acquired immunity, and, for non-essential travellers,
                  screening from pre-departure molecular testing. Importation
                  risk was estimated weekly from July to November 2021 as the
                  number of imported cases and percent positivity (PP; i.e.
                  imported cases normalised by travel volume). The impact of
                  pre-departure testing was assessed by comparing three
                  scenarios: baseline (pre-departure testing of all
                  non-essential travellers; most probable importation risk given
                  the pre-departure testing requirements), counterfactual
                  scenario 1 (no pre-departure testing of fully vaccinated
                  non-essential travellers), and counterfactual scenario 2 (no
                  pre-departure testing of non-essential travellers). RESULTS:
                  In the baseline scenario, weekly imported cases and PP varied
                  over time, ranging from 145 to 539 cases and 0.15 to 0.28\%,
                  respectively. Most cases arrived from the USA, Mexico, the
                  United Kingdom, and France. While modelling suggested that
                  essential travellers had a higher weekly PP (0.37 - 0.65\%)
                  than non-essential travellers (0.12 - 0.24\%), they
                  contributed fewer weekly cases (62 - 154) than non-essential
                  travellers (84 - 398 per week) given their lower travel
                  volume. Pre-departure testing was estimated to reduce imported
                  cases by one third (counterfactual scenario 1) to one half
                  (counterfactual scenario 2). CONCLUSIONS: The model results
                  highlighted the weekly variation in importation by traveller
                  group (e.g., reason for travel and country of departure) and
                  enabled a framework for measuring the impact of pre-departure
                  testing requirements. Quantifying the contributors of
                  importation risk through mathematical simulation can support
                  the design of appropriate public health policy on border
                  measures.},

                  that Agents.jl is not only the most performant but also the

                  insights into the range dynamics of species facing
                  non-equilibrium conditions, such as climate and land-use
                  changes or invasive species. Their consideration of underlying
                  mechanisms relaxes the species-environment equilibrium assumed
                  by correlative approaches, while also generating
                  conservation-relevant indicators, such as range-wide abundance
                  time-series and migration rates if demographically explicit.
                  However, the computational complexity of mechanistic models
                  limits their development and applicability to large
                  spatiotemporal extents.We developed the R package ‘metaRange’
                  that is a modular framework to build population-based and
                  metabolically constrained range models. It provides a function
                  catalogue for users to calculate niche-based suitability,
                  metabolic scaling, population dynamics, biotic interactions,
                  and kernel-based dispersal, which may include directed
                  movement. The framework’s modularity enables the user to
                  combine, extend, or replace these functions, making it
                  possible to customize the model to the ecology of the study
                  system. The package supports an unlimited number of static or
                  dynamic environmental factors as input, including climate and
                  land use.As an example, we simulated 100 virtual species in
                  Germany on a 1 km2resolution over 110 years under realistic
                  environmental fluctuations in three scenarios: without
                  competition, with competition, and with competition and a
                  generalist-specialist trade-off. The results are in accordance
                  with theoretical expectations. Due to the population-level,
                  the package can execute such extensive simulation experiments
                  on regular enduser hardware in a short amount of time. We
                  provide detailed technical documentation, both for the
                  individual functions in the package as well as instructions on
                  how to set up different types of model structures and
                  experimental designs.The metaRange framework enables
                  process-based simulations of range dynamic of multiple
                  interacting species on a high resolution and low computational
                  demand. We believe that it allows for theoretical insights and
                  hypotheses testing about future range dynamics of real-world
                  species, which may better support conservation policies

  abstract     = {Understanding the forces that influence natural variation
                  within and among populations has been a major objective of
                  evolutionary biologists for decades. Motivated by the growth
                  in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches
                  to this question make intensive use of simulation methods.
                  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these
                  methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent
                  algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary
                  biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should
                  incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis:
                  formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a
                  powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these
                  principles are carefully applied.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidence suggests that climate change impacts are
                  already observed around the world. Global environmental
                  assessments face challenges to appraise the growing
                  literature. Here we use the language model BERT to identify
                  and classify studies on observed climate impacts, producing a
                  comprehensive machine-learning-assisted evidence map. We
                  estimate that 102,160 (64,958–164,274) publications document a
                  broad range of observed impacts. By combining our spatially
                  resolved database with grid-cell-level human-attributable
                  changes in temperature and precipitation, we infer that
                  attributable anthropogenic impacts may be occurring across
                  80\% of the world’s land area, where 85\% of the population
                  reside. Our results reveal a substantial ‘attribution gap’ as
                  robust levels of evidence for potentially attributable impacts
                  are twice as prevalent in high-income than in low-income
                  countries. While gaps remain on confidently attributabing
                  climate impacts at the regional and sectoral level, this
                  database illustrates the potential current impact of
                  anthropogenic climate change across the globe. Evidence is
                  growing on the impacts of climate change on human and natural
                  systems. A two-step attribution
                  approach—machine-learning-assisted literature review coupled
                  with grid-cell-level temperature and precipitation—allows
                  comprehensive mapping of the evidence on impacts and tentative
                  attribution to anthropogenic influence.},

                  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an IPOH would
                  facilitate knowledge uptake in policy making via a
                  multisectoral approach, and hence support the addressing of
                  infectious disease emergence and re-emergence at the
                  human-animal-environment interface. The potential benefits to
                  pandemic PPR include a clear, unified, and authoritative voice
                  from the scientific community, support to help donors and
                  institutions to prioritise their investments, evidence-based
                  policies for implementation, and guidance on defragmenting the

                  inadequate speed in facilitating response efforts, and
                  coordination challenges among an already dense set of

                  has intensified research on these and other arbovirus diseases
                  worldwide. Investigating the unique mode of vector-borne
                  transmission requires a clear understanding of the roles of
                  vertebrates. One major obstacle to this understanding is the
                  ambiguity of the arbovirus definition originally established
                  by the World Health Organization. The paucity of pertinent
                  information on arbovirus transmission at the time contributed
                  to the notion that vertebrates played the role of reservoir in
                  the arbovirus transmission cycle. Because this notion is a
                  salient feature of the arbovirus definition, it is important
                  to reexamine its validity. This review addresses controversial
                  issues concerning vertebrate reservoirs and their role in
