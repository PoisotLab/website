  abstract     = {Global biodiversity and ecosystem service models typically
                  operate independently. Ecosystem service projections may
                  therefore be overly optimistic because they do not always
                  account for the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecological
                  functions. We review models used in recent global model
                  intercomparison projects and develop a novel model integration
                  framework to more fully account for the role of biodiversity
                  in ecosystem function, a key gap for linking biodiversity
                  changes to ecosystem services. We propose two integration
                  pathways. The first uses empirical data on
                  biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to bridge
                  biodiversity and ecosystem function models and could currently
                  be implemented globally for systems and taxa with sufficient
                  data. We also propose a trait-based approach involving greater
                  incorporation of biodiversity into ecosystem function models.
                  Pursuing both approaches will provide greater insight into
                  biodiversity and ecosystem services projections. Integrating
                  biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem service
                  modeling will enhance policy development to meet global

  abstract     = {Improving models of species' distributions is essential for
                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal
                  Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial Cytochrome Oxidase
                  I). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that
                  molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated,
                  and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units
                  are not consistent with the molecular data. We suggest that
                  Lamellodiscus morphology is probably constrained by strong
                  environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this
                  result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within
                  nuclear 18S and mitochondrial COI genes are compared for
                  several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  explicitly includes resource and population dynamics. We
                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  scales, ecological specialisation, i.e. organisms

                  thought to be a driver promoting niche diversity. It is not

                  specialist-generalist coexistence.MethodsWe reconstruct the
                  structure of five bacteria-phage networks from soil isolates,
                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite
                  performance.ResultsWe show that the co-occurrence of species
                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity
                  can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic
                  levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of
                  interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic
                  complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and
                  apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to
                  ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community
                  dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of
                  ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable
                  predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of
                  species, the structure of their interactions needs to be
                  accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be

                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental

                  predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging
                  ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why
                  species interact, as this will allow the development of
                  mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better
                  characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
                  existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that
                  the current conceptualization of species interaction networks
                  is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future
                  research must start to account for the intrinsic variability
                  of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex
                  networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
                  there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
                  properties related to the establishment of species
                  interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based
                  processes, we show that this new approach will improve our

                  species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
                  Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of
                  ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and
                  why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we
                  build on existing empirical literature to show that the same
                  species may happen to interact in different ways when their
                  local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or
                  when the environment affects either of these factors. We
                  discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing

                  consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if
                  this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
                  singularly the most important factor for the functioning of
                  ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a
                  species to the local environment also play an essential role.
                  Understanding the relative importance of these factors is
                  crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will

                  accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural
                  temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
                  common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the
                  importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of
                  each community was crossed with the temperature from each
                  site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic
                  regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the

                  temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
                  origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with
                  temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of

                  a particular trophic level. Despite theory linking the
                  complementarity of interactions across trophic levels and
                  ecosystem functioning, there is a shortage of empirical tests

                  of these combined effects within a bacteria-phage interaction
                  network. We measured the biomass yield of combinations of
                  bacterial strains under increasing levels of bacteriophage
                  richness. Our results show an increasing impact of phage on
                  bacteria with increasing phage diversity. In contrast, no
                  combination of phages significantly changed the overall
                  productivity of bacterial mixed cultures when compared with
                  expectations based on bacterial monocultures. Finally, we
                  found that the addition of phages decreases the realized niche
                  overlap among pair of bacterial species with the greatest
                  reduction occurring when all phages were present. Our results
                  show that the productivity of this system is the results from
                  the combined effects of exploitative (shared resources between
                  bacteria) and apparent (shared phages between bacteria)

                  with far-reaching consequences for the maintenance of
                  functional diversity. Although theoretical studies indicate
                  that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve
                  co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, analyses of
                  larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the

                  ecological bipartite networks of three interaction types
                  (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator),

  abstract     = {Summary There is a growing realization among community
                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  ecology, including examples of facilitative interactions, such
                  as plant‐pollinator networks, and antagonistic interactions,
                  such as virus–host infection networks. Statistical network
                  analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom
                  patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns
                  on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring
                  patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is
                  a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting
                  subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the
                  interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an
                  open‐source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of
                  bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat
                  enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a
                  bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire
                  network) to local (i.e. module‐level) scales – and
                  meta‐analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In
                  common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which
                  a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical
                  significance of these patterns, and enables visualization of
                  latent structures in the network. BiMat is available as an

                  species diversify over macro-evolutionary time-scales, the
                  structure of these networks changes; this happens because
                  species are gained and lost, and therefore add or remove
                  interactions in their communities. The mechanisms underlying
                  such dynamic changes in ecological network structure, however,
                  remain poorly understood. Here we show that several types of
                  ecological interactions share common evolutionary mechanisms
                  that can be parametrised based on extant interaction data. In
                  particular, we found that a model mimicking birth-death
                  processes for species interactions describes the structure of
                  extant networks remarkably well. Moreover, the various types
                  of ecological interactions we considered—seed dispersal,
                  herbivory, parasitism, bacteriophagy, and pollination—only
                  differed in the position they occupy in the parameters’
                  multi-dimensional space. Notably, we found no clustering of
                  parameters values between antagonistic and mutualistic
                  interactions. Our results provide a common modelling framework
                  for the evolution of ecological networks that we anticipate
                  will contribute to the greater consideration of the explicit
                  role played by species interactions in models of
                  macro-evolution and adaptive radiations.}
