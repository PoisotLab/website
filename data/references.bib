                  fragmented across sources, disciplines, formats, and various
                  degrees of open sharing, posing challenges for research on
                  macroecology, evolution, and public health. Here, we solve
                  this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database
                  of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in
                  One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled
                  through both reconciliation of static data sets and
                  integration of dynamically updated databases. These data
                  sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone,
                  including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and
                  higher classification; additional metadata on sampling
                  methodology and evidence strength are also available in a
                  harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the
                  largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with
                  roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521
                  resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified),
                  3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique
                  interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together,
                  these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th
                  of bird diversity, and ∼6\% of the estimated total diversity
                  of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome
                  than any previous database. We show how these data can be used
                  to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution
                  and make suggestions for best practices that address the
                  unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE
                  Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling,
                  tangled network of species interactions. Data on the
                  host-virus network are available from several sources, which
                  use different naming conventions and often report metadata in
                  different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that
                  combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles
                  taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata
                  in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can
                  use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish
                  viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or
                  to build more advanced predictive models, making it an
                  unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global
                  virome.},

  abstract     = {Summary There is a growing realization among community
                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  Diplectanidae) is a genus of common parasites on the gills of
                  sparid fishes. Here we show that this genus is probably
                  undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by
                  the important genetic variability observed within three
                  molecular markers (partial nuclear 18S rDNA, Internal
                  Transcribed Spacer 1, and mitonchondrial Cytochrome Oxidase
                  I). Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that
                  molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated,
                  and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units
                  are not consistent with the molecular data. We suggest that
                  Lamellodiscus morphology is probably constrained by strong
                  environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this
                  result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within
                  nuclear 18S and mitochondrial COI genes are compared for
                  several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the
                  level of diversification within a genus. Overall our results
                  suggest that cryptic speciation events may occur within
                  Lamellodiscus, and discuss the links between morphological and

                  specialisation concerns all species and underlies many major
                  ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet its status as a
                  unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its
                  similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of
                  biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity
                  of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of
                  specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on
                  adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and
                  environmental performance. This covariation itself depends
                  upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and
                  life history and complexity in the environment stemming from
                  factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal
                  heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on
                  specialisation that integrates across the range of biological
                  phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive
                  conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the
                  importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.},

                  such variation impacts bipartite network structure in

                  investigate how temporal environmental heterogeneity affects
                  the evolution of specialization and associated community
                  structure. Environmental productivity influences victim
                  investment in resistance, which will shape patterns of
                  specialization through its regulating effect on enemy

                  ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how
                  species interactions vary through space and time. The
                  integration of biogeography and network theory will yield
                  important results and further our understanding of species
                  interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the
                  difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks.
                  Here, we propose a general framework to study the
                  dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space
                  or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and
                  qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into
                  interactions and species turnover components, so that it is
                  immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We
                  emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition
                  to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small
                  methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists
                  adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large
                  dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight
                  other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a

                  the evaluation of population and species‐level measures is
                  lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that
                  populations and species are the relevant scales for most
                  ecological and evolutionary processes.2. Using examples of
                  simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks
                  representing a continuum of biological interactions, we
                  evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their
                  robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract
                  from data.3. Robustness differed between the measures and in
                  their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists
                  along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices
                  were less separated by their informativity than on the
                  simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of
                  the former.4. Based on these different evaluations for

                  the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are

                  predict which interactions will occur in the emerging
                  ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence
                  of interactions between two species require a good knowledge
                  of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In
                  this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a
                  method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure,
                  using the statistical relationship between predator and prey
                  body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among
                  a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer,
                  for any species of a given species pool, the three
                  species‐specific parameters of the niche model. The method
                  applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to
                  evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering
                  the community. We find that this method gives robust
                  predictions of the structure of food webs and that its
                  efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size
                  relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally
                  illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb

                  and perform an analysis of the relationships between host
                  phylogenetic diversity, parasite specialism, and parasite

                  on a continuum of specialism/generalism is influenced by niche
                  overlap, phage impact on bacterial hosts, and host
                  phylogenetic structure. In addition, using a null-model

                  intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative
                  understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because
                  networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship
                  (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to
                  identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful

                  crucial to determine the scale at which networks should be

                  parasites (ectoparasitic gamasid mites) differ when either
                  facultative or obligatory parasites only are considered. More
                  importantly, the structure of these networks is opposed, with
                  obligatory parasites networks being more modular, and
                  facultative parasites networks being more nested. Our results
                  have consequences for the way we define which species to

                  modularity, which when applied to the same network, can return
                  both different modularity values (i.e. different estimates of

                  it is still unclear what ecological conditions might favor
                  their emergence. Studies suggest that the initial evolution of
                  protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic
                  variants with similar life histories, but different
                  competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a
                  model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a
                  protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more
                  pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist
                  invasion are more likely with increased environmental
                  productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the
                  invaded patch exceeding a threshold, highlighting the likely
                  importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity.
                  Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional

                  there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic

                  predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging
                  ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why
                  species interact, as this will allow the development of
                  mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better
                  characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the
                  existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that
                  the current conceptualization of species interaction networks
                  is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future
                  research must start to account for the intrinsic variability
                  of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex
                  networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that
                  there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or
                  properties related to the establishment of species
                  interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based
                  processes, we show that this new approach will improve our
                  predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how
                  species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
                  Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of
                  ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and
                  why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we
                  build on existing empirical literature to show that the same
                  species may happen to interact in different ways when their
                  local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or
                  when the environment affects either of these factors. We
                  discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing
                  frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species
                  interactions.},

                  culture, the common chimpanzee. Although social learning of

                  functional diversity. Although theoretical studies indicate
                  that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve
                  co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, analyses of
                  larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the
                  pervasiveness of coexistence. In this paper, we analyze 175
                  ecological bipartite networks of three interaction types
                  (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator),
                  and measure the extent to which these communities are composed
                  of species with different levels of specificity in their
                  biotic interactions. We find a continuum from specialism to
                  generalism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that diversity tends
                  to be greatest in networks with intermediate connectance, and
                  argue this is because of physical constraints in the filling
                  of networks.},

  abstract     = {Summary There is a growing realization among community
                  ecologists that interactions between species vary across space
                  and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our
                  current numerical framework to analyse the structure of
                  species interactions, based on graph‐theoretical approaches,
                  usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As
                  this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological
                  information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of
                  network structure so that they can exploit it. We present
                  analytical expressions of key measures of network structured,
                  adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological
                  interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a
                  Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the
                  expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its
                  variance. When applied to non‐probabilistic data, the measures
                  we present give the same results as their non‐probabilistic
                  formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We
                  present three case studies that highlight how these measures
                  can be used, in re‐analysing data that experimentally measured
                  the variability of interactions, to alleviate the
                  computational demands of permutation‐based approaches, and to
                  use the frequency at which interactions are observed over
                  several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We
                  provide a free and open‐source implementation of these
                  measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation
                  of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application
                  of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

                  analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom
                  patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns
                  on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring
                  patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is
                  a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting
                  subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the
                  interactions form ordered subsets. Here we describe BiMat, an
                  open‐source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of
                  bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat
                  enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a
                  bipartite ecological network – spanning global (i.e. entire
                  network) to local (i.e. module‐level) scales – and
                  meta‐analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In
                  common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which
                  a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical

                  nutrient cycling. These changes can then indirectly affect
                  ecologically processes by altering trophic dynamics, the
                  persistence of a species in a given environment, and,
                  consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if
                  this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is
                  singularly the most important factor for the functioning of
                  ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a
                  species to the local environment also play an essential role.
                  Understanding the relative importance of these factors is
                  crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will
                  have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more complete
                  understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is
                  necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as
                  the influences of species distribution and local adaptation,
                  with ecosystem and community ecology. By using the microbial
                  community inhabiting the water-filled leaves of Sarracenia
                  purpurea, we tested the importance of temperature, trophic
                  structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem functioning. We
                  accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural
                  temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a
                  common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the
                  importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of
                  each community was crossed with the temperature from each
                  site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic
                  regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the
                  mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found that
                  temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than
                  origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with
                  temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of
                  temperature and biotic interactions when predicting the

                  that investigating the diversity of what organisms actually do
                  (i.e., their functional traits) within ecosystems will
                  generate more reliable insights into the ways these ecosystems
                  behave, compared to considering only species diversity. But
                  this promise also rests on several conceptual and
                  methodological (i.e., epistemic) assumptions that cut across
                  various theories and domains of ecology. These assumptions

                  Because metawebs are typically expressed at large spatial and
                  taxonomic scales, assembling them is a tedious and costly
                  process; predictive methods can help circumvent the
                  limitations in data deficiencies, by providing a first
                  approximation of metawebs. One way to improve our ability to
                  predict metawebs is to maximize available information by using
                  graph embeddings, as opposed to an exhaustive list of species

                  momentum as a way to circumvent limitations in data volume.
                  Yet, ecological networks are challenging to predict because
                  they are typically small and sparse. Dealing with extreme
                  class imbalance is a challenge for most binary classifiers,
                  and there are currently no guidelines as to how predictive
                  models can be trained for this specific problem. Using simple
                  mathematical arguments and numerical experiments in which a
                  variety of classifiers (for supervised learning) are trained
                  on simulated networks, we develop a series of guidelines
                  related to the choice of measures to use for model selection,
                  and the ways to assemble the training dataset. Neither
                  classifier accuracy nor the area under the receiver operating
                  characteristic curve (ROC‐AUC) are informative measures for
                  the performance of interaction prediction. The area under the
                  precision‐recall curve (PR‐AUC) is a fairer assessment of
                  performance. In some cases, even standard measures can lead to
                  selecting a more biased classifier because the effect of
                  connectance is strong. The amount of correction to apply to
                  the training dataset depends on network connectance, on the
                  measure to be optimized, and only weakly on the classifier.
                  These results reveal that training machines to predict
                  networks is a challenging task, and that in virtually all
                  cases, the composition of the training set needs to be
                  fine‐tuned before performing the actual training. We discuss
                  these consequences in the context of the low volume of data.},

                  expanding, motivated in part by concerns around emerging
                  zoonoses. One consequence is the proliferation of host–virus
                  association data, which underpin viral macroecology and
                  zoonotic risk prediction but remain fragmented across numerous
                  data portals. In the present article, we propose that
                  synthesis of host–virus data is a central challenge to
                  characterize the global virome and develop foundational theory
                  in viral ecology. To illustrate this, we build an open
                  database of mammal host–virus associations that reconciles
                  four published data sets. We show that this offers a
                  substantially richer view of the known virome than any
                  individual source data set but also that databases such as
                  these risk becoming out of date as viral discovery
                  accelerates. We argue for a shift in practice toward the
                  development, incremental updating, and use of synthetic data
                  sets in viral ecology, to improve replicability and facilitate

                  coevolution, we develop a quantitative, spatially explicit
                  framework for mapping the evolutionary risk of viral
                  emergence. Driven by interest in diseases like Severe Acute
                  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
                  (MERS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we examine
                  the global biogeography of bat-origin betacoronaviruses, and
                  find that coevolutionary principles suggest geographies of
                  risk that are distinct from the hotspots and coldspots of host
                  richness. Further, our framework helps explain patterns like a
                  unique pool of merbecoviruses in the Neotropics, a recently
                  discovered lineage of divergent nobecoviruses in Madagascar,

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and

                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of

                  conservation, especially in light of global change. Species
                  distribution models (SDMs) often rely on mean environmental
                  conditions, yet species distributions are also a function of
                  environmental heterogeneity and filtering acting at multiple
                  spatial scales. Geodiversity, which we define as the variation
                  of abiotic features and processes of Earth's entire geosphere
                  (inclusive of climate), has potential to improve SDMs and
                  conservation assessments, as they capture multiple abiotic
                  dimensions of species niches, however they have not been
                  sufficiently tested in SDMs. We tested a range of geodiversity
                  variables computed at varying scales using climate and
                  elevation data. We compared predictive performance of MaxEnt
                  SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclimatic variables to those
                  also including geodiversity variables for 31 mammalian species
                  in Colombia. Results show the spatial grain of geodiversity
                  variables affects SDM performance. Some variables consistently
                  exhibited an increasing or decreasing trend in variable
                  importance with spatial grain, showing slight scale-dependence
                  and indicating that some geodiversity variables are more
                  relevant at particular scales for some species. Incorporating
                  geodiversity variables into SDMs, and doing so at the
                  appropriate spatial scales, enhances the ability to model
                  species-environment relationships, thereby contributing to the
                  conservation and management of biodiversity. This article is

                  within species to differences between populations,
                  communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult
                  to realize in great part because of the complexity of
                  biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of
                  theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other
                  theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic
                  diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial
                  stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to
                  consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to
                  ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require
                  theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to
                  reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have
                  solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic
                  to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution
                  are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty.
                  Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and
                  probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich
                  knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent
                  complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability
                  to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and
                  explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge

                  causes of variation in species composition in ecological
                  communities, less effort has been invested in understanding
                  how interactions between these species vary. Given that
                  interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of
                  ecological communities, we need to develop a better
                  understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we
                  investigate whether species interactions vary more in response
                  to different climate variables than do individual
                  species.LocationEurasia.Time period2000s.Major
                  taxaAnimalia.MethodsWe used a measure of local contribution to
                  β‐diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51
                  host–parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic
                  fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We
                  measured uniqueness based on the species composition and based
                  on potential and realized biotic interactions (here,
                  host–parasite interactions).ResultsWe show that species
                  interactions vary more, across space, than do species. In
                  particular, we show that species interactions respond to some
                  climatic variables that have no effect on species
                  distributions or dissimilarity.Main conclusionsSpecies
                  interactions capture some degree of variation that is not
                  apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this

                  different ways as a response to different environmental
                  factors, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss
                  the implications of this finding for the amount of information

                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary

                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could

               is currently limited given the complexity of acquiring repeated

               of metawebs highlight efficient ways to first document possible
               interactions within regional species pools. Downscaling metawebs
               towards local network predictions is a promising approach to use
               current data to investigate the variation of networks across

               variability and uncertainty of species interactions, especially
               for large-scale food webs. Here, we present a probabilistic
               framework to downscale a metaweb based on the Canadian mammal
               metaweb and species occurrences from global databases. We
               investigated how our approach can be used to represent the
               variability of networks and communities between ecoregions in

               revealed additional areas of variation in network structure

               offers the potential to bring global predictions down to a more

  abstract  = {NCBITaxonomy.jl is a package designed to facilitate the
               reconciliation and cleaning of taxonomic names, using a local
               copy of the NCBI taxonomic backbone (Federhen 2012, Schoch et al.
               2020); The basic search functions are coupled with
               quality-of-life functions including case-insensitive search and
               custom fuzzy string matching to facilitate the amount of
               information that can be extracted automatically while allowing
               efficient manual curation and inspection of results.
               NCBITaxonomy.jl works with version 1.6 of the Julia programming
               language (Bezanson et al. 2017), and relies on the Apache Arrow
               format to store a local copy of the NCBI raw taxonomy files. The
               design of NCBITaxonomy.jl has been inspired by similar efforts,
               like the R package taxadb (Norman et al. 2020), which provides an
               offline alternative to packages like taxize (Chamberlain and
               Szöcs 2013).},

                  impacts can combine additively or can interact, causing
                  synergistic or antagonistic effects. Our knowledge of when and
                  how interactions arise is limited, as most models and
                  experiments only consider the effect of a small number of
                  non-interacting stressors at one or few scales of ecological
                  organization. This is concerning because it could lead to
                  significant underestimations or overestimations of threats to
                  biodiversity. Furthermore, stressors have been largely
                  classified by their source rather than by the mechanisms and
                  ecological scales at which they act (the target). Here, we
                  argue, first, that a more nuanced classification of stressors
                  by target and ecological scale can generate valuable new
                  insights and hypotheses about stressor interactions. Second,
                  that the predictability of multiple stressor effects, and
                  consistent patterns in their impacts, can be evaluated by
                  examining the distribution of stressor effects across targets
                  and ecological scales. Third, that a variety of existing
                  mechanistic and statistical modelling tools can play an
                  important role in our framework and advance multiple stressor

  abstract     = {Food webs are complex ecological networks whose structure is
                  both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
                  network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
                  the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
                  webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in
                  network ecology is still rare. This is surprising considering
                  that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely designed for
                  understanding and predicting many types of constrained
                  systems. This principle asserts that the least-biased
                  probability distribution of a system's property, constrained
                  by prior knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
                  information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
                  ecological modeling problems, but its application in food webs
                  and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show how
                  MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties both
                  analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the joint
                  degree distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
                  numbers of prey and predators for each species in the network)
                  can be derived analytically using the number of species and
                  the number of interactions in food webs. Second, we present a
                  heuristic and flexible approach of finding a network's
                  adjacency matrix (the network's representation in matrix
                  format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy. We built
                  two heuristic models using the connectance and the joint
                  degree sequence as statistical constraints, respectively. We
                  compared both models' predictions against corresponding null
                  and neutral models commonly used in network ecology using open
                  access data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled
                  globally (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model
                  constrained by the joint degree sequence was a good predictor
                  of many measures of food-web structure, especially the
                  nestedness and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results
                  suggest that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food
                  webs is mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.},

                  The increase in anthropogenic pressure was linked to a
                  decrease of both population density and individual size.
                  Differences in mean size and densities were detected for P.
                  lividus between a site with high anthropogenic pressure and

                  an example study, which documented a novel alphacoronavirus
                  found in bats in Belize. Finally, we outline best practices
