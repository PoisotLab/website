title: Research themes

We are a question-driven group with interests in many processes, systems, and techniques. The common thread to our research is: how can we measure and predict complex ecological systems more accurately, so we can turn this knowledge into more efficient decisions and actions?

For each theme, you will find a list of our publications, and a short blurb that contextualizes the work we do on this theme. Themes that we are *very actively* working on have a little flame next to their title (<i class="ri-fire-line"></i>). Themes that we are *very interested in* as long-term problems have little sparkles next to theirs (<i class="ri-sparkling-line"></i>). Themes without a little symbol are built into our every day work.

**The recipe to design a kick-ass research project if you are interested in [joining us](/opportunities/) is simple**:
