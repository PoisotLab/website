Can we use ecological information to make predictions about emerging viral
pathogens? We apply biotic interaction inference techniques, network analysis,
and secies distributions models, to provide mapping of the risk posed by various
groups of pathogens.

This research provides a challenging opportunity to apply methods from
fundamental computational ecology into a new area. We work within the
[VERENA](http://viralemergence.org/) consortium to build models that help assess
the emergence risk of various viruses, in collaboration with disease ecologists,
public health scientists, and virologists, we can give these tools a new life!
