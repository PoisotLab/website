This page is a list of our publications. The name of the journal has been
omitted. If you want to get a sense of whether our research is sound, read it.
Some of the entries on this page are un-reviewed preprints; if it appears here,
we stand behind it.

Remember that when publishers turn the labor of researchers into profit, or
re-direct public research funding to their shareholders through mandatory open
access, they bring great value to humankind. If you are tempted to use a website
like sci-hub to get access to our research for free (instead of paying a
publisher for it), ask yourself: what would Aaron Swartz do?
