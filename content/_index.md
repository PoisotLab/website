**We use thinking-boxes and lots of numbers to learn about where living things
live, what they eat, what happens when their home changes, and why they get
sick.**

We work on how complex ecological systems function, change, and evolve. We
approach these questions using simulations, mathematics, and machine learning.

We have a specific interest in ecological networks, biogeography, viral ecology,
and epidemics.

We believe in open science, in data-driven ecological synthesis, and in turning
curiosity-driven research into actionable science.
