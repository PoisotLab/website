title: Join the group!
---

We currently have one opening at the post-doctoral level (one year, with a
possible extension until Nov. 2025), to work on the development of spatial
indicators to monitor processes at the biodiversity/disease interface in space
and under climate change scenarios.

By working closely with the [GEO BON](https://geobon.org/) secretariat, and the
[viral emergence research initiative](https://www.viralemergence.org/), this
work will **support the development of a methodology to provide information on
optimal Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV)** for disease monitoring, with a specific focus on
the monitoring of host-virus systems.

Ultimately, this project will result in an **assessment of the feasibility of
multi-purpose spatial networks of locations that can inform on statuses and
trends for biodiversity**, with a special interest for zoonotic diseases,
showing how the methodology of ecosystem sciences translates to ecosystem
conservation and global health.

## Details on the position

The position will be hosted at the Université de Montréal, and includes a travel
allowance as well as budget for a laptop, both on a per-need basis. Université
de Montréal is a francophone institution; the Computational Ecology Research
Group is a multi-lingual laboratory.

Post-doctoral researchers at Université de Montréal are part of a union with a
set salary scale; the yearly salary for this position is 59241 CAD annually,
which corresponds to the maximal allowed amount, with union-mandated yearly
increases. Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the hourly rate (but is not expected to
be required as part of this project).

The position is a **one year** (renewable) appointment, with a starting date to
be discussed (ideally July/August). We are specifically aiming to hire a
*junior* post-doc (*i.e.* within a year of defending their *Ph.D.*). Because of
the deadlines of this specific grant, priority will be given to applicants that
are already eligible to work in Canada (including US citizens who can apply for a work permit rapidly), and have already defended their *Ph.D.*.

### Required qualifications

*Required* qualifications are used to triage applications -- applicants who do
not possess these qualifications will not be considered.

- strong quantitative background in disease ecology *or* spatial ecology
- above average programming skills
- *Ph.D.* in disease ecology *or* wildlife epidemiology *or* spatial/landscape ecology

### Desired qualifications

*Desired* qualifications for the position are listed below. *Desired*
qualifications means that it would be nice for the applicant to have them, but
they can be picked up rapidly by a motivated scientist.

The desired qualifications, listed in no specific order, are:

- development, maintenance, or significant contributions to software packages,
  showing good practices in software engineering
- contribution to a "Software Note" or "Application" article
- experience in using distributed computing systems (CPU and/or GPU)
- expertise in using a version control system (`git` in particular)
- knowledge of the *Julia* programming language, or strong willingness to learn
- global understanding of contemporary issues in biodiversity governance
- a commitment to open science as a practice -- because we recognize that not
  everyone can safely contribute to open science, this will be assessed both by
  looking at realizations, or by the narrative in the letter of presentation

## How to apply

Applications should be send by email directly to `timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`,
with the subject line "Ecosystems post-doc: FIRST AND LAST NAMES". Applications
will be reviewed starting immediately and continue until the position is filled.

The application should contain a two-pages letter of presentation
(`name-letter.pdf`) containing a brief overview of past research, a description
of how you meet the required and desired qualifications, and a statement of
interest for the position and the project. The application should also contain a
*short* resume (`name-resume.pdf`; no more than three pages), focusing on
professional accomplishments (grades and funding history, as they are strongly
biased against under-represented minorities, will not be evaluated, and do not
need to be mentioned).

The interview process involves three steps that are typically completed within
two weeks:

- a one-hour discussion with Timothée to talk about qualifications and
motivation
- a discussion with self-nominated current and former group members,
to get a sense of what life is like in the lab, the department, the university,
etc.
- a discussion to go through the logistics and to prepare the
offer.
