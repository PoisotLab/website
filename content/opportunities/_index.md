title: Join us!
---

We currently have one opening at the post-doctoral level (one year, with a
possible extension), to work on the coupling between biodiversity and ecosystem
models in order to develop a flexible, modular simulation toolkit to assist
stakeholder-engaged design of monitoring networks. In collaboration with an
already group of researchers, the aim of this project is to **develop a
biomonitoring optimization program that can recommend locations to monitor
ecosystem status**, within a biological region of interest, that are optimal now
and under climate change scenarios, in order to capture relevant changes in
biodiversity.

By working closely with the [GEO BON](https://geobon.org/) secretariat, and the
[viral emergence research initiative](https://www.viralemergence.org/), this
work will **support the development of a methodology to provide information on
the optimal Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV)**, with a specific focus on
the monitoring of the host-virus system.

Ultimately, this project will result in an **assessment of the feasibility of
multi-purpose spatial networks of locations that can inform on statuses and
trends for biodiversity**, with a special interest for zoonotic diseases,
showing how the methodology of ecosystem sciences translates to ecosystem
conservation and global health.

Existing data (grey boxes to the left) will flow through existing codebases for ecosystem structure (EcoSISTEM.jl), community structure (Diversity.jl, Phylo.jl, EcologicalNetworks.jl), climatic data (SimpleSDMLayers.jl, SpatialDataSources.jl), and biological dynamics (BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl), which will then be coupled to create new simulation models. This task will form the bulk of the work of post-doctoral fellow 1. The output of these simulations will serve to develop BioSurveillance.jl (led by post-doctoral fellow 2), which will be used, through interactions with stakeholders, to simulate multi-purpose monitoring networks, and validate them through case studies in biodiversity and disease dynamics at several spatial (100s to 1000s km²) and temporal (extant to 100 years horizon) scales. The case studies will be carried out by graduate students already working on spatial biodiversity monitoring and spatially explicit disease surveillance, and will serve as a unique opportunity to put these tools to use in a variety of situations, and with a variety of collaborators and stakeholders.](files/wellcome_conceptual_figure.png)

## Details on the position

The position will be hosted at the Université de Montréal, and comes with yearly
travel money, and a lump sum for computer equipment (one laptop and two
monitors).

Post-doctoral researchers at Université de Montréal are part of a union with a
set salary scale; the yearly salary for this position is 59241 CAD annually,
with union-mandated yearly increases. Overtime is paid at 1.5 times the hourly
rate.

The position is a **one year** (renewable) appointment, with a starting date to
be discussed. We are specifically aiming to hire a *junior* post-doc (*i.e.*
immediately after *Ph.D.*). Because of the deadlines of this specific grant,
priority will be given to applicants that are already eligible to work in
Québec.

### Required qualifications

Strong quantitative/statistical background in disease ecology, and particularly
on spatial analyses

*Ph.D.* in disease ecology *or* wildlife epidemiology, *or* *DMV* with evidence
of quantitative skills (ideally completed at the time of application, or within
a few months of completion)

### Desired qualifications

Desired qualifications for the position are listed below. *Desired*
qualifications means that it would be nice for the applicant to have them, but
they can be picked up rapidly by a motivated scientist. *Required*
qualifications listed after them will be used to triage applications --
applicants who do not possess these qualifications will not be considered.

The desired qualifications, listed in no specific order, are:

- development, maintenance, or significant contributions to software packages,
  showing good practices in software engineering
- contribution to a "Software Note" or "Application" article
- experience in using distributed computing systems (CPU and/or GPU)
- expertise in using a version control system (`git` in particular)
- knowledge of the *Julia* programming language, or strong willingness to learn
- work with stakeholders, notably through participation in facilitated or
  stakeholder-engaged workshops or projects
- global understanding of contemporary issues in biodiversity governance
- experience in tropical or temperate ecosystems ecology
- a commitment to open science as a practice -- because we recognize that not
  everyone can safely contribute to open science, this will be assessed both by
  looking at realizations, or by the narrative in the letter of presentation

## How to apply

Applications should be send by email directly to `timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`,
with the subject line "Ecosystems post-doc 3: NAME". Applications will be
reviewed starting immediately and continue until the positions are filled.

The application should contain a two-pages letter of presentation
(`name-letter.pdf`) containing a brief overview of past research, a description
of how you meet the required and desired qualifications, and a statement of
interest for the position and the project. The application should also contain a
*short* resume (`name-resume.pdf`; no more than three pages), focusing on
professional accomplishments (grades and funding history, as they are strongly
biased against under-represented minorities, will not be evaluated, and do not
need to be mentioned).

The interview process involves three steps that are typically completed within
two weeks: a one-hour discussion with Timothée to talk about qualifications and
motivation; a discussion with self-nominated current and former group members,
to get a sense of what life is like in the lab, the department, the university,
etc.; finally, a discussion to go through the logistics and to prepare the
offer.
