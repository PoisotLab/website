  abstract     = {Local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) can be used to
                  identify sites with high ecological uniqueness and exceptional
                  species composition within a region of interest. Yet, these
                  indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
                  relatively few sites, as they require information on complete
                  community compositions difficult to acquire on larger scales.
                  Here, we investigated how LCBD indices can be predicted over
                  broad spatial extents using species distribution modelling and
                  examined the effect of scale changes on beta diversity
                  quantification. We used Bayesian additive regression trees
                  (BARTs) to predict warbler species distributions in North
                  America based on observations recorded in the eBird database.
                  We then calculated LCBD indices for observed and predicted
                  data and compared the site‐wise difference using direct
                  comparison, a spatial association test and generalized linear
                  regression. We also examined the relationship between LCBD
                  values and species richness in different regions and at
                  various spatial extents. Our results showed that species
                  distribution models provided uniqueness estimates highly
                  correlated with observed data. The form and variance of the
                  LCBD–richness relationship varied according to the region and
                  the total extent size. The relationship was also affected by
                  the proportion of rare species in the communities. Therefore,
                  sites identified as unique over broad spatial extents may vary
                  according to regional characteristics. These results show that
                  species distribution modelling can be used to predict
                  ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents, which could
                  help identify beta diversity hotspots and important targets
                  for conservation purposes in unsampled locations.},

                  surveillance, it remains difficult and costly to identify and
                  monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses.
                  Statistical models can guide sampling target prioritisation,
                  but the predictions from any given model might be highly
                  uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and
                  the drivers of model performance are consequently
                  under-documented. Here, we use the bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process
                  of comparing and validating predictive models of probable
                  reservoir hosts. In early 2020, we generated an ensemble of
                  eight statistical models that predicted host-virus
                  associations and developed priority sampling recommendations
                  for potential bat reservoirs of betacoronaviruses and bridge
                  hosts for SARS-CoV-2. During a time frame of more than a year,
                  we tracked the discovery of 47 new bat hosts of
                  betacoronaviruses, validated the initial predictions, and
                  dynamically updated our analytical pipeline. We found that
                  ecological trait-based models performed well at predicting
                  these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently
                  performed approximately as well or worse than expected at
                  random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensemble
                  modelling as a buffer against mixed-model quality and
                  highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive
                  models. Our revised models showed an improved performance
                  compared with the initial ensemble, and predicted more than
                  400 bat species globally that could be undetected
                  betacoronavirus hosts. We show, through systematic validation,
                  that machine learning models can help to optimise wildlife
                  sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such
                  approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of
                  prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.},
